wraithfire blast travels at a speed of 1200. the stun and movement speed slow are applied at the same time, so overall, the slow lasts for 4/4.2/4.4/4.6 ( 6/6.2/6.4/6.6) seconds. casting wraithfire

skeletons spawn at a random spot within a 300 radius of wraith king. these skeletons reincarnate once when killed. this cannot be prevented. just like with hero reincarnation, killing the skeletons grants no gold or experience bounty when they reincarnate. reincarnating does not reset the skeleton's duration. this means they do not reincarnate when expiring either. these skeletons cannot be controlled. they automatically choose an attack target within 6500 range. if no unit is within that range, they move to the closest lane and walk it down like lane creeps. if their current attack target turns invisible, the skeletons may stop and do nothing. after a while, they select a new target or return to the lanes. the skeletons do not block neutral creep camps. casting wraithfire blast on a target affects the following things: upon its cast point, it orders all skeletons within 2000 radius to attack that target, even when the ability is blocked, reflected, or disjointed. the order lasts for 2 seconds. if the skeletons do not reach the target within the order duration, they automatically search for a new target within 600 radius. successive wraithfire blast casts from the same faction, re-order the skeletons to attack the latest affected target. wraithfire blast casts while the skeletons reincarnate do not order them to attack the target. talent the reincarnation casts wraithfire blast talent also do not order the skeletons to attack the target as well. applies a total damage manipulation on the skeletons' attack damage when attacking buildings and heroes. treat creep-heroes as heroes and illusions as creeps. though this effect is not shown in attack damage hud, but actually stacks additively with other total damage manipulation source (e.g. enfeeble). stacks multiplicatively with other unique incoming damage manipulation sources (e.g. reinforced). therefore, the skeleton's damage dealt against buildings can be defined as expr skeletondamagedealt 0.585.

spawn. conspirators against the wraith king wonder why he never stays dead. wraith king's reincarnation has the highest priority in the group of reincarnation sources. this means when combined with other sources (e.g. aegis of the immortal), this ability will be activated first as long as wraith king has enough mana and the ability is off-cooldown. revives with full health and mana. does not resets the cooldowns of items and abilities. provides 1800 daytime and 800 nighttime ground vision respectively at wraith king's death location during its delay. double-tapping automatically targets self. the current health as self-inflicted damage is applied instantly upon cast, effectively killing himself. when wraith king is invulnerable or hidden, he is unable to cast abilities on himself, hence being unable to double-tapping to activate reincarnation. the movement speed slow is applied on enemy heroes and clones upon triggering reincarnation. treat illusions and creep-heroes as creeps. 1/2/3 ( 3/4/5) wraith king skeletons are also summoned for each enemy hero within 900 radius upon triggering reincarnation. skeleton notes of vampiric spirit fully apply. if it is not learned, no skeletons are summoned. treats clones as heroes, illusions and creep-heroes as creeps. the skeletons are also summoned for enemies inside the fog of war and invisible units. scepter reincarnation now provides another radius aura and its buff lingers for 0.5 seconds. the aura only affects all ally heroes, clones and illusions. does not affect invulnerable or hidden heroes, and creep-heroes. the aura is bestowed to nearby allies even while wraith king is dead. scepter wraith delay's 7-second duration triggers when the hero reaches 1 health. units in wraith form are kept alive by having their minimum health set to 1. damage taken is technically not reduced. does not trigger in the following circumstances: if the target is affected by shallow grave, battle trance, or have other reincarnation sources. if the target is an illusion, despite the aura affecting them. if the unit dies by its duration expiring (e.g. the tempest double). if the unit is instant killed (e.g. killed by culling blade). when meepo or its meepo clones is instantly killed due to either the prime or any one of its clones dying, including being denied, during the wraith delay. scepter grants the affected heroes phased and unobstructed movement, allowing them to move through units and trees and impassable terrain. wraith form causes the hero's model size to increase by 25% for its duration. this has no impact on its collision size. it also increases movement speed by 25% and attack speed by 75 for the duration. allies in wraith form can act freely like regular heroes, and can still be interacted normally, without any restrictions. this means they still are fully affected by attacks and abilities normally, and already existing buffs and debuffs continue to affect them. during wraith delay, the hero's health bar is visible to allies only. scepter when the wraith delay duration ends, the hero dies. the kill is credited to whoever put the hero in wraith form. this death cannot be prevented in any way. it ignores invulnerability and everything that would typically prevent death. if the hero has reincarnation sources, it triggers normally once the hero dies. affected ally heroes have their respawn time reduced by 10% as shown at the chart below. talent with the reincarnation casts wraithfire blast talent, wraithfire blast gets cast on enemies within 900 radius upon triggering

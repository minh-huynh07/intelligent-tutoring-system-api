modifier_stunnedStrongAbility Draft Notes:
 Wraithfire Blast only orders  Wraith King Skeletons to attack the affected target.Does not affect any other player-controlled units.
Ostarion calls on his damned lineage, laying waste to his opponents.


Wraithfire Blast travels at a speed of 1200.
The stun and movement speed slow are applied at the same time, so overall, the slow lasts for 4/4.2/4.4/4.6 ( 6/6.2/6.4/6.6) seconds.
Casting Wraithfire Blast orders all of  Wraith King Skeletons within ≈2000 radius to attack the affected target, even when the ability is blocked, reflected, or disjointed.
Increases Wraith King Skeletons' total movement and attack speed to 375 and 125 respectively .
Upon cast, it deals the impact damage instantly, and the damage over time in 1-second intervals, starting immediately after the stun.
Can deal up to 135/210/285/360 ( 155/250/345/440) damage (before reductions).
TALENT The duration increasing  talent immediately updates the currently active instance and also increases the damage over time.
The blast first applies the impact damage, then the debuffs.
Successive casts do not update the ability values but increase the debuff duration.
TALENT With the Reincarnation casts Wraithfire Blast  talent, Wraithfire Blast gets cast on enemies within 900 radius upon triggering  Reincarnation.
These projectile travels at a speed of 500.
Only targets enemy heroes and clones.
Treats illusions and creep-heroes as creeps.
These blasts can target enemies inside the Fog of War and invisible units. However, invisible targets instantly disjoint them.
These Wraithfire Blasts are passively cast automatically and instantly, regardless of mana and cooldown.
They fully replace Reincarnation's slow, however, only when both Wraithfire Blast and the  talent are learned. Vampiric Spirit  Link▶️Link▶️WV

Notes

Reincarnate once when killed.



Stacks additively with other lifesteal sources.
Cannot lifesteal off of wards, buildings, and ally units.
The lifesteal aura affects Wraith King and  Wraith King Skeleton within 1200 radius. Does not affect other heroes or any of Wraith King's player-controlled units.
Grants 1  Wraith King Skeleton charge per 2 units killed by Wraith King or any of his player-controlled units within the same aura radius.
Does not grant charges from denies.
Spawns 1 skeleton per charge.
TALENT The min number of Skeletons spawned  increases the base number of skeletons spawn to 5, resulting in 5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13 at 0 ‒ 8 charges.
The skeletons spawn in 0.25-second intervals, starting immediately upon cast.
This results in a total spawn time of 0/0.25/0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2/2.25/2.5/2.75/3/3.25/3.5 seconds.
Does not spawn the remaining skeletons if Wraith King dies during the total spawn time.
The skeletons spawn at a random spot within a 300 radius of Wraith King.
These skeletons reincarnate once when killed. This cannot be prevented.
Just like with hero reincarnation, killing the skeletons grants no gold or experience bounty when they reincarnate.
Reincarnating does not reset the skeleton's duration. This means they do not reincarnate when expiring either.
These skeletons cannot be controlled. They automatically choose an attack target within ≈6500 range.
If no unit is within that range, they move to the closest lane and walk it down like lane creeps.
If their current attack target turns invisible, the skeletons may stop and do nothing. After a while, they select a new target or return to the lanes.
The skeletons do not block neutral creep camps.
Casting  Wraithfire Blast on a target affects the following things:
Upon its cast point, it orders all skeletons within ≈2000 radius to attack that target, even when the ability is blocked, reflected, or disjointed.
The order lasts for 2 seconds. If the skeletons do not reach the target within the order duration, they automatically search for a new target within ≈600 radius.
Successive Wraithfire Blast casts from the same faction, re-order the skeletons to attack the latest affected target.
Wraithfire Blast casts while the skeletons reincarnate do not order them to attack the target.
TALENT The Reincarnation casts Wraithfire Blast  talent also do not order the skeletons to attack the target as well.
Applies a Total Damage Manipulation on the skeletons' attack damage when attacking buildings and heroes.
Treat creep-heroes as heroes and illusions as creeps.
Though this effect is not shown in Attack Damage HUD, but actually stacks additively with other Total Damage Manipulation Source (e.g.  Enfeeble).
Stacks multiplicatively with other unique incoming damage manipulation sources (e.g.  Reinforced).
Therefore, the skeleton's damage dealt against buildings can be defined as expr SkeletonDamageDealt × 0.585. Mortal Strike  Link▶️EE



AbilityPassive
AffectsEnemies


Wraith King passively deals bonus damage on an attack with a cooldown.

Critical Damage: 150%/200%/250%/300%


 5.5/5/4.5/4 ( 3.5/3/2.5/2)
Illusion Notes:Critical strike values shown are before illusion outgoing damage and armor reduction.Modifiers [?]modifier_skeleton_king_mortal_strikeUndispellable
One blow to crush a foe.


If another source of critical strike procs on the same attack as Mortal Strike, the crit with the higher multiplier takes priority.
A critical strike proc is determined during Wraith King's attack point.
When a critical strike procs, Wraith King uses a specific crit attack animation, and particle effects appear on his weapon.
Does not proc upon attacking wards, buildings, and allies.
Missed attacks do not trigger the ability cooldown. Reincarnation   Link▶️Link▶️RR

modifier_skeleton_king_reincarnate_slowAnyAbility Draft Notes:
 Vampiric Spirit has to be drafted as well for  Wraith King Skeletons to spawn.
Conspirators against the Wraith King wonder why he never stays dead.


Wraith King's Reincarnation has the highest priority in the group of Reincarnation sources. This means when combined with other sources (e.g.  Aegis of the Immortal), this ability will be activated first as long as Wraith King has enough mana and the ability is off-cooldown.
Revives with full health and mana. Does not resets the cooldowns of items and abilities.
Provides 1800  daytime and 800  nighttime ground vision respectively at Wraith King's death location during its delay.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
The current health as self-inflicted damage is applied instantly upon cast, effectively killing himself.
When Wraith King is invulnerable or hidden, he is unable to cast abilities on himself, hence being unable to ↓↓ Double-tapping to activate Reincarnation.
The movement speed slow is applied on enemy heroes and clones upon triggering Reincarnation.
Treat illusions and creep-heroes as creeps.
1/2/3 ( 3/4/5)  Wraith King Skeletons are also summoned for each enemy hero within 900 radius upon triggering Reincarnation.
Skeleton notes of  Vampiric Spirit fully apply. If it is not learned, no skeletons are summoned.
Treats clones as heroes, illusions and creep-heroes as creeps.
The skeletons are also summoned for enemies inside the Fog of War and invisible units.
SCEPTER Reincarnation now provides another  radius aura and its buff lingers for 0.5 seconds.
The aura only affects all ally heroes, clones and illusions.
Does not affect invulnerable or hidden heroes, and creep-heroes.
The aura is bestowed to nearby allies even while Wraith King is dead.
SCEPTER Wraith Delay's 7-second duration triggers when the hero reaches 1 health.
Units in Wraith Form are kept alive by having their minimum health set to 1. Damage taken is technically not reduced.
Does not trigger in the following circumstances:
If the target is affected by  Shallow Grave,  Battle Trance, or have other Reincarnation sources.
If the target is an illusion, despite the aura affecting them.
If the unit dies by its duration expiring (e.g. the  Tempest Double).
If the unit is instant killed (e.g. killed by  Culling Blade).
When  Meepo or its  Meepo Clones is instantly killed due to either the Prime or any one of its clones dying, including being denied, during the Wraith Delay.
SCEPTER Grants the affected heroes phased and unobstructed movement, allowing them to move through units and trees and impassable terrain.
Wraith Form causes the hero's model size to increase by 25% for its duration. This has no impact on its collision size.
It also increases movement speed by 25% and attack speed by 75 for the duration.
Allies in Wraith Form can act freely like regular heroes, and can still be interacted normally, without any restrictions.
This means they still are fully affected by attacks and abilities normally, and already existing buffs and debuffs continue to affect them.
During Wraith Delay, the hero's health bar is visible to allies only.
SCEPTER When the Wraith Delay duration ends, the hero dies. The kill is credited to whoever put the hero in Wraith Form.
This death cannot be prevented in any way. It ignores invulnerability and everything that would typically prevent death.
If the hero has Reincarnation sources, it triggers normally once the hero dies.
Affected ally heroes have their respawn time reduced by 10% as shown at the chart below.
TALENT With the Reincarnation casts Wraithfire Blast  talent, Wraithfire Blast gets cast on enemies within 900 radius upon triggering  Reincarnation.
These projectile travels at a speed of 500.
Only targets enemy heroes and clones.
Treats illusions and creep-heroes as creeps.
These blasts can target enemies inside the Fog of War and invisible units. However, invisible targets instantly disjoint them.
These Wraithfire Blasts are passively cast automatically and instantly, regardless of mana and cooldown.
They fully replace Reincarnation's slow, however, only when both Wraithfire Blast and the  talent are learned.

the damage increases by 2.06/3.22/4.39/5.56 ( 4.28/5.44/6.61/7.78) for every server tick spent channeling. while channeling, illuminate creates vision fields in front of keeper of the light. the vision fields provide 400 range flying vision and last for 10.34 seconds each. the first vision field spawns 150/180/210/240 range in front of ezalor. the following field spawn the same distance away from the previous vision field. the vision fields spawn in 0.5-second intervals, starting 0.5 seconds after channeling start, resulting in up to 5 fields. when the channeling is canceled, it stops spawning vision fields. this does not affect the travel distance of the wave. when fully channeled, all vision fields together reach up to 1150/1300/1450/1600 range away with their vision. the visual effect of illuminate's shockwave gets stronger the longer it was channeled. illuminate and illuminate (spirit form) are two separate abilities. both of these abilities share the same cooldown, casting

check and updates the slow value if the accumulated distance exceeds 10. if the target moved a distance greater than 1200 between a check, the movement speed slow value is not increased. there is no cap to the slow value, it can continue to grow indefinitely. the status debuff's description shows how strong the slow currently is. the particle effects get stronger the higher the slow gets, capped

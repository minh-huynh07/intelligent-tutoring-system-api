Ezalor's hidden light reveals itself in marvelous fashion.


The wave travels at a speed of 900, taking 1.72 seconds to travel the full distance.
With the travel distance and radius, it can hit units up to 1950 range away.
The damage increases by 2.06/3.22/4.39/5.56 ( 4.28/5.44/6.61/7.78) for every server tick spent channeling.
While channeling, Illuminate creates vision fields in front of Keeper of the Light.
The vision fields provide 400 range flying vision and last for 10.34 seconds each.
The first vision field spawns 150/180/210/240 range in front of Ezalor. The following field spawn the same distance away from the previous vision field.
The vision fields spawn in 0.5-second intervals, starting 0.5 seconds after channeling start, resulting in up to 5 fields.
When the channeling is canceled, it stops spawning vision fields. This does not affect the travel distance of the wave.
When fully channeled, all vision fields together reach up to 1150/1300/1450/1600 range away with their vision.
The visual effect of Illuminate's shockwave gets stronger the longer it was channeled.
Illuminate and  Illuminate (Spirit Form) are two separate abilities.
Both of these abilities share the same cooldown, casting illuminate put its Spirit Form counterpart ability on cooldown as well.

Stacks multiplicatively with other  magic resistance sources.
Applies 3.5% magic resistance reduction on the affected target per 100 distance moved.

Checks the target's current position once upon cast and then in 0.1-second intervals, resulting in 61 checks.
On each check, it compares the target's current position with its position on the last check and updates the slow value if the accumulated distance exceeds 10.
If the target moved a distance greater than 1200 between a check, the movement speed slow value is not increased.
There is no cap to the slow value, it can continue to grow indefinitely. The status debuff's description shows how strong the slow currently is.

Requires  Aghanim's Scepter to be unlocked.
The Ignis Fatuus starts flickering 1 second after cast, and then every 2.85 seconds, up to 5 times.
While flickering, it moves enemies 60 units towards the wisp, and locks their facing angle on it.
Does not disable enemies in any other way.
Periodically checks enemies within the radius that are not affected by the debuff when the  Ignis Fatuus flickers on, and immediately applies the debuff to them.
This means that although the debuff is dispellable, it is instantly reapplied to the unit as long as it stays within the radius.
Only attacks from heroes and clones can damage the Ignis Fatuus.
Although creeps can attack the Ignis Fatuus, their attacks do not damage the Ignis Fatuus. Treats attacks from illusions and creep-heroes as creeps.
Towers ignore the Ignis Fatuus.
Destroys trees within the radius upon cast, and within 150 radius around affected enemies at the end of the pull.
Multiple casts work independently of each other.

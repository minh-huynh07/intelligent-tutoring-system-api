things: interrups the spirit bear's current channeling abilities. automatically levels up all of the spirit bear's abilities. resets the current cooldown of entangling claws. dispels both buffs and debuffs on the spirit bear while disjointing projectiles. the backlash damage is dealt as pure damage to lone druid sourced from the unit that killed the spirit bear. denying the spirit bear causes no

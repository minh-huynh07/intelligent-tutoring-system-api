Dragon Slave travels at a speed of 1200, taking 0.9 seconds to travel the full distance.
With the travel distance and end radius, it can hit units up to 1275 range away.
The complete area is shaped like a cone.
Dragon Slave first applies the base damage, then the debuff.
Applies a debuff on enemies upon impact which deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after it is placed, resulting in 3 instances.
Can deal up to 105/210/315/420 total damage (before reductions).
The debuff from successive cast does not stack but refreshes the duration.
Deals the following amount of damage:
SCEPTER While  Flame Cloak is active, it can deal up to 141.75/283.5/425.25/567 damage.
SHARD
With max  Fiery Soul stacks, it can deal up to 245/350/455/560 damage.
The ability damage bonus per stack does not affect the damage per second component.
With both Flame Cloak active and max Fiery Soul stacks, it can deal up to 330.75/472.5/614.25/756 while active.
TALENT The critical strike only applies to the caster's attacks against the debuffed enemy, other units under their control do not crit.
If the caster is a  ranged hero, already launched attacks do not crit if the target gets tracked before projectile impact.
Vice versa, already launched attacks do crit if the track debuff expires before the projectiles land.
If another source of critical strike procs on the same attack, the higher multiplier has priority. Light Strike Array Link▶️Link▶️WT

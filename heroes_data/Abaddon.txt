Abaddon releases a coil of deathly mist that can damage an enemy unit or heal a friendly unit at the cost of some of Abaddon's health.

Aghanim's Shard Upgrade:

Causes Mist Coil to deal Abaddon's attack damage on impact.

Spell Block / Reflection Notes:Blocked upon impact, therefore, self-damage still occurs.Blocked as primary and secondary target.Ability Disjoint Notes:Disjointable by both enemies and allies.A mysterious vapor from the Font of Avernus now infuses the breath of Abaddon, who releases it at will.


The projectile travels at a speed of 1300.
Deals pure damage to self and magical damage to enemies.
The self-inflicted damage is applied instantly upon cast and never lethal, so it cannot be used to deny oneself.
Deals 40/70/100/130 ( 56/86/116/146) damage (before amplifications) to self.
Always heals for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much damage Abaddon actually takes.
Cannot target invulnerable, hidden or untargetable units.
For the targeted ally, the projectile still heals upon hit before they turn invulnerable or hidden.
However, if the projectile hits once the targeted unit turns untargetable, Mist Coil does not apply its ability effects to the targeted unit.
Does not affect  Couriers.
SHARD Mist Coil now causes Abaddon to perform an instant attack on enemy targets on projectile hit.
These instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers (e.g.  Curse of Avernus) and on-hit effects normally. They have True Strike and completely ignore disarms.
If the caster is a  ranged hero, the instant attacks do not use attack projectiles and are instant, but still count as ranged attacks.
Cleave effects are based on the target's position, damaging a trapezoid area in the opposite direction where the projectile came from.
Mist Coil first applies its own damage, then the instant attack.
TALENT
The heal and damage increasing  talent immediately upgrades all of Abaddon's currently flying Mist Coil projectiles.
The area of effect  talent adds a radius to this ability. The ability must be centered over a unit still.
Upon cast, Abaddon sends Mist Coils based on its current level towards every ally and enemy within 400 radius, excluding himself.
These behave just like a regular cast, and can be disjointed normally.
Mist Coil also targets units inside the Fog of War and invisible units. However, invisible targets instantly disjoint it.
Fully affect untargetable units.
Although it cannot be directly cast on  Couriers and on already untargetable units, they are still considered valid secondary units, following the ability targeting notes as above.
Fully affects Couriers.
Deals one instance of self-damage to Abaddon, regardless of how many Mist Coils are released.
SCEPTER Does not upgrade the passive releases of  Borrowed Time.
SHARD The  Ability Upgrade notes fully apply. Aphotic Shield Link▶️Link▶️WT

AffectsAllies  / Enemies
DamagePhysical

Summons dark energies around an ally unit, creating a shield that absorbs a set amount of damage before expiring. When the shield is destroyed it will burst and deal damage equal to the amount it could absorb to an area around it. Removes certain types of negative buffs and stuns on cast.

The powers of the black mist rise to absorb attacks like the black mist absorbs light.


Aphotic Shield first applies the buff, then the strong dispel on the target upon cast.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
Applies a  universal damage barrier on the affected target that absorbs damage values of all damage types, causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity.
Stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources.
Universal damage barrier has the lowest priority in the group of damage barriers, its capacity is depleted last when combined with other damage-type barriers.
However, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g.  Borrowed Time or  Refraction), Aphotic Shield does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire.
Losing the Aphotic Shield buff always causes it to burst and deal area damage, no matter how the shield was lost.
Therefore, successive casts on the same unit do not stack but destroy the shield, dealing its area damage, and a new one is applied.
If the damage absorbed equals the shield capacity, the shield will burst at the next damage instance.
Does not deal damage to invisible units or units in the Fog of War.
Can deal damage to untargetable units from  Book of Shadows and  Shadow Realm.
Always deals the full 120/150/180/210 ( 220/250/280/310) area damage (before reductions) upon losing the buff in any way.
TALENT The damage barrier capacity and damage increasing  talent does not affect any of the current active instances.
Increases both the damage barrier capacity and burst area damage despite the talent description stating it increases the damage barrier capacity only. Curse of Avernus   Link▶️EF

Abaddon strikes an enemy, slowing the target's movement speed. If the target gets hit 4 times, they become affected by a chilling curse causing them to be silenced and slowed, and all attacks against them gain an attack speed boost. Damage over time component to buildings is multiplied by 0.7.

Increase Curse of Avernus base slow.

Break Notes:Prevents placing the initial debuff or increasing its counter.If the target is already debuffed, prevents allies from gaining the speed buff upon attacking the cursed enemy.
Illusion Notes:Illusions can increase the hit counter if they have this ability.Modifiers [?]modifier_abaddon_frostmourneUndispellable

Each successful attack was done on an enemy unit without the curse debuff, places the initial debuff, or increases its counter if it already has the debuff.
The initial debuff's duration gets refreshed on each hit. The required hits do not need to all happen within 5 seconds.
When the initial debuff's counter reaches 3 ( -77), the next attack removes the initial debuff and applies the curse debuff.
TALENT The movement speed slow increasing  talent only increases the curse movement speed slow.
Deals damage in 0,5-second intervals, starting 0,5 after applying the curse debuff.
Deals up to 80/120/160/200 ( 280/320/360/400) damage to units (before reductions).
Deals up to 24/36/48/60 ( 84/96/108/120) damage to  buildings.
The attack speed buff is only granted to ally heroes when successfully landing an attack on the cursed enemy target.
For Abaddon, this restriction does not apply and the buff is granted as soon as the curse debuff is applied.
For ally heroes, this means the buff is not applied if the attack is missed.
For  ranged ally heroes, they gain the buff only upon projectile impact.
Executing an attack against a unit that is not cursed removes the buff.
Treats ally illusions and clones as heroes, ally creep-heroes as creeps.
Fully affect buildings.
However, the debuff cannot be placed on wards, allies or attached units. Borrowed Time   Link▶️RB

When activated, all damage dealt to you will heal instead of harm. Most negative buffs will also be removed. If the ability is not on cooldown, it will automatically activate if your health falls below 400.

modifier_abaddon_immolation_damageUndispellableAbility Draft Notes:
 Mist Coil must be drafted as well for it to get applied.
The most unnatural of all the gifts of the Font of Avernus, this power defies mortal understanding. What should hurt, instead heals; and what should kill gives strength anew.


Interrupts Abaddon's channeling abilities when manually cast.
However, it does not interrupt Abaddon's channeling abilities when passively activated.
The passive activation does not count as an ability cast.
Can be cast even while stunned, cycloned, slept, taunted, hidden, or during forced movement.
Borrowed Time cannot be manually activated while silenced, hexed or prevented from acting, but it can be passively activated.
Abaddon is unable to ⇧ Shift-queue this ability.
Applies a strong dispel upon cast, be it manually or passively activated.
Passively activates when a damage instance, including 0-damage instances, drops Abaddon's health below 400, or hits Abaddon while already below 400 health.
Does not passively activate in the following conditions:
If the damage instance exceeds Abaddon's current health before Borrowed Time is activated, he dies without Borrowed Time activating.
Instant kill sources (e.g.  Culling Blade and  Ice Blast).
HP Removal flags and setting health sources lowering Abaddon's health below the passive health threshold.
Borrowed Time fully negates damage (before all reductions), causing several on-damage effects to not trigger.
This means armor, magic resistance, damage manipulation, and Damage Barriers do not affect or react on the negated damage.
The only exception is  Mana Shield, which is calculated before Borrowed Time.
This includes damage flagged as HP Removal, but not health setting sources, and instantly killing effects.
The heal is based on the amount of damage that got negated but can still be subjected to heal manipulation.
SCEPTER Borrowed Time now provides a 1200 radius aura and its buff lingers for 0.5 seconds.
Neither affects invulnerable nor hidden units. Treats clones, illusions and creep-heroes as heroes.
SCEPTER Places a damage-counting buff on allies within the radius, counting any damage the ally takes after all reductions.
The damage counter does not react on damage flagged as HP Removal.
The counted damage is checked on each damage instance. This means only one  Mist Coil may be released per damage instance, no matter the amount of damage taken.
If the counted damage is higher than the 525 health trigger threshold, the threshold value gets subtracted from it, and a Mist Coil gets released.
Since the threshold value gets subtracted from the counted damage, excess damage of big damage instances is not lost, and directly counts towards the next possible trigger.
This means a single 1575 damage instance (i.e. 3 times larger than the trigger threshold) triggers one Mist Coil, but the next two damage instances are guaranteed to trigger a Mist Coil each.
SCEPTER The damage counter has no reset timer. It only resets when the ally loses the buff in between damage instances.
Mist Coil based on the current level are passively cast automatically and instantly, regardless of mana and cooldown, and even while Abaddon is disabled.
Mist Coil notes fully apply. If it is not learned, no coils are released.
TALENT The area of effect  talent does not upgrade passively released Mist Coils.
TALENT The Immolation damage per second  talent adds another 400 radius aura and its debuff lingers for 0.5 seconds.
Neither affects invulnerable nor hidden units.
Deals 25 damage per interval to Abaddon and enemies in range, starting 0.25 seconds after cast, resulting in 18/22/26 ( 30/34/38) instances.
The self-damage is turned into healing as long as Borrowed Time is active. However, Abaddon takes damage normally afterward due to the aura debuff lingering. The damage is lethal and can be used to deny oneself.
Can deal up to 450/550/650 ( 750/850/950) damage (before reductions) and self heal up to 400/500/600 ( 700/800/900) health.
SPELL STEAL Passively released  Mist Coil is based on  Abaddon's current ability level when acquired.

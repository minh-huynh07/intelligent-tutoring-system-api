Alt-Cast Icon
Boundless Strike's effect length is neither affected by cast range bonuses, nor by attack range bonuses.
The ability's effects are instantly applied within its whole area. There is no travel time.
The effect starts 75 range in front of Monkey King and has an actual length of 1025, adding up to 1100 effective length.
With the starting distance, effect length, and width, it can hit units up to 1250 range away.
It can also hit units 75 range behind Monkey King, due to its radius and starting position.
Causes Monkey King to perform an instant attack on all hit enemies. The stun is independent from these attacks.
These instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally, except cleave. They have True Strike, but completely ignore disarms.
Despite the audio effect,  Daedalus has still only a chance to proc. Boundless Strike does not guarantee chance-based effects to proc.
Boundless Strike has an ensured critical strike, crits with a lower value have no effect if they proc, since the higher crit value takes priority.
Boundless Strike procs  Jingu Mastery, placing the debuff on all hit enemy heroes, or adding one hit to the counter if the target is already debuffed.
If Monkey King has the Jingu Mastery buff, it loses a charge whenever Boundless Strike is cast, regardless of whether it hits a unit or not.
The bonus attack damage and lifesteal from Jingu Mastery are applied to all hit targets, despite using up only one charge.
During  Tree Dance, casting Boundless Strike does not unperch Monkey King.
The strike first applies the debuff, the instant attack, moves Monkey King, then the Primal Spring ability effects.
The sound during the cast animation is audible to everyone.
Does not affect  Couriers.
SHARD Upon acquiring the  Ability Upgrade, it has Alt-cast disabled by default.
With Alt-Cast activated, Boundless Strike moves Monkey King 1100 range away upon cast, to the end of the ability's effect length.
Monkey King is prevented from acting and moves at a speed of 5000 – 30000 for up to 0.2 seconds, with a height between 100 – 150 upwards in an arc.
This means the leap distance can be reduced/increased by jumping up/down a ramp or impassable terrain.
60% max power based on the current level of  Primal Spring is applied within  upon landing at the end of the staff.
When interrupted by non-upward forced movement sources, the area damage and movement speed slow are applied prematurely at the Monkey King's new landing location.
Upward movement sources fully interrupt and prevent Primal Spring from being applied.
The Primal Spring applied is independent of the ability and does not cost any mana.
Primal Spring notes fully apply. If it is not learned, it is not applied.
SPELL STEAL The instant attack uses  Rubick's projectile to attack the affected targets, therefore it is disjointable. Uses the normal cast animation when stolen. Tree Dance   Link▶️Link▶️WT

Monkey King jumps to a tree and perches atop it. While perched, he gains the Primal Spring ability-a channeled leap attack. If Monkey King's tree is destroyed, he falls and is stunned for 4 seconds. Taking damage from player controlled units or Roshan while on the ground puts Tree Dance on cooldown.

Replaces  Primal Spring while on a tree, instead of being in a separate slot.The drafting hero cannot jump to other trees without returning to the ground first.
Sun Wukong dances nimbly along the treetop canopy, always just out of arm's reach.


Monkey King leaps to the target tree at a speed of 800, reaching the tree within up to 1.13 ( 1.69) seconds.
Moves Monkey King upwards in an arc, with a top height of 192. During the leap, other units may pass below Monkey King.
The activity modifier only appears during the leap and is responsible for the leaping animation.
Although it visually looks like Monkey King is above the ground while perched, he still is considered to be on the ground. The height is part of the animations.
Tree Dance has several different cooldowns which activate at different times.
When cast, the leap's total duration is added to the cooldown, resulting in a cooldown of 1.5/1.3/1.1/0.9 – 2.53/2.33/2.13/1.93 ( 3.09/2.89/2.69/2.49) seconds.
Upon unperching with a move ( Right Click) or attack command (A), it goes on cooldown for 1.4/1.2/1/0.8 seconds.
Does not go on cooldown when unperched in other ways.
Player-based damage, regardless of factions, fountain-based and  Roshan-based damage greater than 0 (after reductions) puts the ability on a 3-second cooldown.
Does not react on self-damage and damage flagged as HP Removal.
All of these cooldowns are unaffected by percentage-based cooldown reductions, but are affected by flat reductions and cooldown resets.
During the leap, Monkey King is disabled and prevented from acting. The last given order gets queued up and executed as soon as he lands.
The leap is immediately canceled if the distance between Monkey King and the targeted tree exceeds 1850.
Tree Dance has the highest priority in the group of base vision setting effects.
During the leap and while on a tree, Monkey King gains flying vision, but has his  daytime and  nighttime vision reduced to 700 and 500 respectively.
Other vision bonus sources (e.g.  Shade Sight) are applied after the vision reduction.
 Consume's  nighttime vision bonus is also granted to the caster during the leap and while on the tree.
While perched on a tree, the following effects are applied to Monkey King:
Sets Monkey King's movement speed to 0.
Monkey King is now hidden from sight. He can only be seen with flying vision.
He can also be seen when standing 2 levels of ground higher than the tree Monkey King sits on, allowing  Observer Wards to spot him when the ward is on an elevated spot.
However, he cannot be seen when getting thrown in the air by upward movement sources (e.g.  Toss).
While on a tree, Monkey King can perform any action normally, with some of them unperching him, while others do not.
Casting  Boundless Strike,  Mischief or any item abilities does not unperch him.
Casting  Wukong's Command, moving or attacking does unperch him.
Directional Move and Patrol have no effect when ordered while on a tree.
While Tree Dance is on cooldown, Monkey King is disarmed and unable to move while perched on a tree, preventing him from attacking and unperching.
Forced movement, cyclone and teleport sources (e.g.  Blink Dagger-based items) unperches Monkey King as well.
While on a tree, Tree Dance can be cast again, targeting another nearby tree. All trees within cast range are highlighted with a white glow.
Monkey King cannot cast Tree Dance on the tree he is perching on.
Monkey King only gets stunned if the tree he perches on is destroyed. Getting unperched in other ways (e.g. forced movement) does not result in a stun.
The unperch stun is applied even when Monkey King is debuff immune, invulnerable or hidden, and its stun duration is not affected by status resistance.
SPELL STEAL  Primal Spring and the  Spring Early sub-ability is granted if this ability is the last cast ability.  Rubick is not hidden from sight due to collision size, he is also unperched upon losing this ability.

Leaping from the safety of cover into the midst of his enemies, Sun Wukong attacks without mercy.


This ability is only active during the cast time of  Tree Dance, during the leap from the ground onto a tree, and while on a tree.
It is inactive while leaping from one tree to another, and while on the ground.
Leaps towards the target area at a speed of 1300, reaching it in up to 0.77 seconds, based on distance.
Primal Spring is also canceled if the distance between the tree he is perching on and the target area exceeds 1850.
Moves Monkey King upwards in an arc, with a top height of 192. During the leap, other units may pass below Monkey King.
The activity modifier only appears during the leap and is responsible for the leaping animation.
When targeting beyond the max leap distance, Monkey King leaps for the max distance towards the targeted point.
The damage and movement speed slow values are based on the time spent channeling, meaning their potency increases per each server tick spent channeling, up to 51 times.
The damage increases by 2.8/4.2/5.6/7 per server tick, starting immediately, reaching 142.8/214.2/285.6/357 damage in 1.5 seconds.
The slow increases by 0.4%/0.8%/1.2%/1.6% per server tick, also starting immediately, reaching 20%/40%/60%/80% slow in 1.5 seconds.
Successive Primal Spring hits on the same enemies refresh the slow duration but does not update the movement speed slow values based on the channel time.
Primal Spring's ability effects are canceled in the following conditions:
If Monkey King is affected by other forced movement sources while leaping.
When the tree Monkey King is perched on is destroyed while channeling Primal Spring.
Primal Spring first applies the damage, then the debuff.
The visual effects at the target area during the channeling are visible to allies only, but the channeling sound is audible to enemies, even through the Fog of War.

Jingu Mastery does not work for the  Wukong's Command Soldiers. They can neither add stacks on enemies nor gain the buff if Monkey King had it upon cast.

Ability Draft Notes:
This ability is bound to  Wukong's Command, instead of being innate to Monkey King. However, only Monkey King can disguise himself as a tree.
Watch out for that tree.


This is an innate ability and does not need to be learned. It is bound to Monkey King himself.
Interrupts Monkey King's channeling abilities, move orders and attack orders upon cast.
Transforms Monkey King into a random nearby entity. For more information, see here.
Monkey King's selection box adapts to the disguise's models. However, his collision size does not change.
During  Tree Dance, casting Mischief does not unperch Monkey King.
Monkey King's minimap icon is hidden from the enemy while disguised.
If disguised as a unit, Monkey King's over-head health bar copies the look of that unit's health bar, including the team color.
If disguised as an item, rune, or tree, Monkey King's health bar is fully hidden.
All auto-attack settings ignore the Monkey King while in disguise. Lane creeps, neutral creeps, towers, and fountains do not automatically attack him.
Units of players which have auto attack settings of ◉ Standard or ◎ Always and the ground-attack command does not attack him automatically either, but can be forced to attack him (A).
Monkey King is still fully affected by other abilities, and he can still be targeted normally. Attachable particle effects of abilities are still attached to him.

Monkey King rips out a tuft of fur to blow at his enemies, charging each strand to transform into a copy of himself.

      Wukong's Command soldiers' formations.        Total size of all 3 rings.   
Upon cast, 14 ( 21) clones of Monkey King spawn which immediately walk to their determined spot in the formation.
They walk at a speed of 700 and have unobstructed movement.
The formation they take is always the same except when space is limited by the edges of the map. A diagram on the right shows the soldier's formation on each ring.
The first ring soldiers form a pentagon within a 300 radius circle, with the tip always facing north.
The second ring soldiers form a nonagon within a 750 radius circle, with the tip always facing north as well.
TALENT The third ring soldiers form a heptagon within a 1100 radius circle, with the tip always facing north as well.
The soldiers have phased movement, are invulnerable and considered hidden (although visible), making them immune to almost every ability.
They are uncontrollable, unselectable, and can neither pick up nor drop any items.
They copy most of Monkey King's items, and can use attack modifiers and bestow auras he had upon cast.
The soldiers are hero clones of Monkey King, copying  all attributes of Monkey King, with some special exceptions. They are not illusions.
Their base stats and attributes adapt whenever summoned (e.g. permanent attribute loss from  Glaives of Wisdom or  Essence Shift).
While the clones can be affected by attack speed buffs and slows, they may only attack once per 1.2 seconds, even if their attack misses.
However, the soldiers are fully affected by attack animation bonus sources.
Their  daytime and  nighttime vision is set to 600. They provide the vision while walking to their spot and while standing there.
The soldiers only attack enemy heroes, clones, creep-heroes and illusions they see inside Wukong's Command.
Invisible enemies and enemies inside the Fog of War within the circles are not attacked.
Other units and any unit outside the circle are fully ignored, even when within attack range of a soldier.
Since the soldiers use regular attacks, their damage is reduced by damage block.
The buffs of a consumed  Aghanim's Blessing and  Aghanim's Shard are copied as well.
However, other permanent buffs (e.g.  Moon Shard or  Duel) are not copied.
If Monkey King moves more than 780 ( 1130) range away from the center of the circle, or when he dies, the soldiers disappear and the ability ends.
Successive casts immediately end the current instance while active.
When Monkey King dies, the soldiers immediately disappear.
 Jingu Mastery does not work for the clones. They neither can add stacks on enemies, nor gain the buff if Monkey King had it upon cast.
SCEPTER This restriction is now removed upon acquiring  Aghanim's Scepter. It now works for the clones, although slightly different.
Instead of placing a debuff on their attack target to count attacks, the clones themselves gain the counter instead.
This means Jingu Mastery works independently for each clone and does not interfere with Monkey King's current stacks.
Clones treat creep-heroes as creeps.
SCEPTER The passive soldiers' spawn uses a fixed replenish time instead of a spawn interval. The charge replenish timer counts even without having  Aghanim's Scepter. This means a soldier will immediately spawn upon acquiring the item.
Upon replenishing a charge, but Monkey King's condition does not allow passive spawns, Wukong's Command spawns the soldier as soon as the circumstances allow it to.
The passive soldiers do not spawn in the following conditions:
While Monkey King is affected by the  Tree Dance bounce leap and bounce perch modifiers.
While disguised with  Mischief.
While Monkey King is fully invisible, hidden or dead.
The fixed replenish time is not affected by any cooldown reduction sources.
Passively spawned soldiers can attack any unit, except  Roshan.
The passive soldiers only attack buildings when Monkey King is within 500 range of them.
However, the buildings attacking restriction is not applied to  ranged heroes.
TALENT The additional Wukong's command ring also increases the cast range of this ability.
SPELL STEAL Grants  Jingu Mastery despite not showing in any of the stolen ability slots. This ability's cast point is also not modified when acquired. Soldiers still provide vision, but they stop attacking and moving upon losing ability. Soldiers from the previous cast neither continue attacking nor moving upon re-acquiring ability.

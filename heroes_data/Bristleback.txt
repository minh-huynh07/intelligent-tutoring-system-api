centered at the cast location, it does not follow bristleback. places one debuff on each hit enemy and a stack debuff on each cast on each hit enemy. the first debuff shows the number of stack debuffs on the status icon. the stack debuffs are hidden. the stacks' durations are independent of each other. successive casts do not refresh previous stacks' durations. with the current cooldown and stack duration, it can be stacked up to 5 times. to reach the damage cap, additional passive procs from bristleback are required. the damage cap can be reached with 18/17/15/14 ( 11/11/10/9) stacks. to

receives, except from damage flagged as hp removal (e.g. sunder). when taking rear damage, his effective health increases by 19%/32%/47%/67% ( 32%/47%/67%/92%). when taking side damage, his effective health increases by 9%/14%/19%/25% ( 14%/19%/25%/32%). checks the damage source's current position and compares it to bristleback's facing angle on each damage instance. this means on damage over time effects (e.g. liquid fire), damage of an instance is only reduced when within the reduction angle. damage from death ward, proximity mines is reduced when facing away from them since they are their own source. passive quill sprays based on its current level proc when bristleback's back (not sides) collectively receives 275/250/225/200 damage (after all reductions). passive procs do not interrupt bristleback's channeling abilities. if quill spray is not learned, no quills are procced. the damage counter accumulates damage from the 3 damage types, but not from hp removal sources or from the no-reflection flag (e.g. blade mail). the damage counter has no time limit and only resets once a passive spray occurs. any exceeding damage is accumulated, a single damage instance can trigger multiple passive quill spray procs per damage threshold. these sprays are independent of the cooldown, they do not trigger the ability's cooldown and work while on cooldown. they do not cost mana or proc on-cast effects either. grants 1 warpath stack per passive proc. scepter adds an active component to bristleback, with the passive effects still present. upon cast, bristleback is disarmed and rotates gradually with a turn rate of 5 until its back completely faces the targeted direction. 0.5 seconds after cast, bristleback launches 1 quill spray based on its current level per 0.35-second intervals up to 6 sprays, for a total duration of 3.5 seconds. grants up to 6 warpath stack per cast. gets interrupted only when hexed. other disables like stuns, taunts, cyclones or fear may change the direction sprays are fired at. keeps spraying when hidden by any source. scepter the following effects are applied on bristleback while the spray is active: reduces bristleback's turn rate to 0. while active, all of bristleback's abilities, including item abilities, do not require facing the target to cast, as long as the target is within the cast range. quill spray notes fully apply. if it is not learned, no sprays are launched. however, the other ability effects on bristleback are still applied. hairball link link link link db abilitytarget area affectsenemies damagemagical coughs a

goo projectile will only hit once, but deal 2 stacks on target. both viscous nasal goo and quill spray notes fully apply. the viscous nasal goo and quill spray released are based on the current level respectively. if neither is leveled, the ball does nothing upon reaching the targeted area. since quill spray travels faster than viscous nasal goo, the quills always hit enemies before the goo does, so the quills do not benefit from the armor reduction. spell steal the viscous nasal goo and quill spray applied is based on bristleback's current ability level when acquired. warpath rw

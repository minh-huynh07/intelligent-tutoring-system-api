Toggling Autocast on swaps this ability out with  Hairball. Their cooldowns are separate.
An enforcer's honor can be a prickly thing. So can his quills.


Interrupts Bristleback's channeling abilities upon cast.
Grants 1  Warpath stack upon cast.
The quills spread at a speed of 2400 and take 0.29 seconds to reach maximum range.
The quills do not form a ring. They affect every enemy within the expanding area of effect, so it cannot be avoided by blinking towards Bristleback.
The effect is centered at the cast location, it does not follow Bristleback.
Places one debuff on each hit enemy and a stack debuff on each cast on each hit enemy.
The first debuff shows the number of stack debuffs on the status icon. The stack debuffs are hidden.
The stacks' durations are independent of each other. Successive casts do not refresh previous stacks' durations.
With the current cooldown and stack duration, it can be stacked up to 5 times. To reach the damage cap, additional passive procs from  Bristleback are required.
The damage cap can be reached with 18/17/15/14 ( 11/11/10/9) stacks.
To reach it, 13/12/10/9 ( 6/6/5/4) passive casts are required without considering cooldown reduction sources.
SCEPTER The damage cap can be reached with 7/6/4/3 passive casts.
TALENT With the stack damage increasing  talent and  Bristleback  Ability Upgrade, Quill Spray can reach its damage cap without any passive casts.
Quill Spray checks how many stacks units have first and deals damage based on that, then increases the number of stacks.
The first hit only deals the base damage.
For how much damage Quill Spray deals with a certain amount of stack on each level (before reductions), please refer to the chart below.

Turning his back to a fight might be just the thing.

      Bristleback's angles visualised.  
A visual effect and sound play whenever his back receives damage if Bristleback has learned  Quill Spray.
Taking damage from the sides shows no effect.
Applies generic incoming damage reduction on Bristleback. Stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation.
Reduces all damage types Bristleback receives, except from damage flagged as HP removal (e.g.  Sunder).
When taking rear damage, his effective health increases by 19%/32%/47%/67% ( 32%/47%/67%/92%).
When taking side damage, his effective health increases by 9%/14%/19%/25% ( 14%/19%/25%/32%).
Checks the damage source's current position and compares it to Bristleback's facing angle on each damage instance.
This means on damage over time effects (e.g.  Liquid Fire), damage of an instance is only reduced when within the reduction angle.
Damage from  Death Ward,  Proximity Mines is reduced when facing away from them since they are their own source.
Passive  Quill Sprays based on its current level proc when Bristleback's back (not sides) collectively receives 275/250/225/200 damage (after all reductions).
Passive procs do not interrupt Bristleback's channeling abilities.
If Quill Spray is not learned, no quills are procced.
The damage counter accumulates damage from the 3 damage types, but not from HP Removal sources or from the no-reflection flag (e.g.  Blade Mail).
The damage counter has no time limit and only resets once a passive spray occurs.
Any exceeding damage is accumulated, a single damage instance can trigger multiple passive Quill Spray procs per damage threshold.
These sprays are independent of the cooldown, they do not trigger the ability's cooldown and work while on cooldown.
They do not cost mana or proc on-cast effects either.
Grants 1  Warpath stack per passive proc.
SCEPTER Adds an active component to Bristleback, with the passive effects still present.
Upon cast, Bristleback is disarmed and rotates gradually with a turn rate of 5 until its back completely faces the targeted direction.

Grants up to 6  Warpath stack per cast.
Gets interrupted only when hexed. Other disables like stuns, taunts, cyclones or fear may change the direction sprays are fired at.
Keeps spraying when hidden by any source.
SCEPTER The following effects are applied on Bristleback while the spray is active:
Reduces Bristleback's turn rate to 0.
While active, all of Bristleback's abilities, including item abilities, do not require facing the target to cast, as long as the target is within the cast range.
Quill Spray notes fully apply. If it is not learned, no sprays are launched.

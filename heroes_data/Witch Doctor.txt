recycles the bones of fallen friends and foes, using the powder as part of his arsenal of charms and alchemy. the initial projectile travels at a speed of 1200, subsequent projectiles travel at a speed of 1000. however, all projectiles bounce in 0.1-second intervals. cannot bounce on the following units: on invisible, invulnerable, hidden or attack immune units. on enemy couriers. can bounce on units in the fog of war. since the projectile cannot be disjointable, already airborne projectiles can bounce to and off of units affected by hidden or spell block sources. the initial target is not counted towards the bounces, resulting in a total of 3/5/7/9 ( 5/7/9/11) instances. all bounces together can deal up to 180/400/770/1350 ( 350/665/1170/1925) to heroes (before reductions). all bounces together can deal up to 270/600/1155/2025 ( 525/997.5/1755/2887.5) to non-hero units. for how much damage each bounce paralyzing cask deals on each level, and with the cask bounce increasing talent, please refer to the chart below. the projectile can bounce on the same unit multiple times, but only when another target was hit between the bounces. this means it may hit the same target a maximum of 2/3/4/5 ( 3/4/5/6) times. can deal up to 120/240/440/750 ( 210/380/650/1050) damage to a single hero. can deal up to 180/360/660/1125 ( 315/570/975/1575) damage to a single creep. the stun duration treats clones, creep-heroes, roshan and the spirit bear as heroes, but treats illusions as creeps. however, the damage treats illusions, clones, and creep-heroes as heroes. the cask first applies the debuff, then the damage. if paralyzing cask is cast multiple times, the previous cast's bounce counter gets reset. all paralyzing cask instances from the source use the same bounce counter, instead of each instance having an independent counter. voodoo restoration link link wv abilitytoggle / aura affectsunits damagemagical witch doctor focuses his magic to heal nearby allied

only hexxing his opponents and is quite adept at curing ailments. voodoo restoration does not interrupt witch doctor's channeling abilities upon toggling on / off. disabling witch doctor does not toggle off voodoo restoration. however, he cannot turn it off himself while disabled either. while witch doctor is invulnerable or hidden, all effects of voodoo restoration still applies. in this case, the mana per second cost will not be consumed. heals for 3.3/7.26/11.22/15.18 health (+ 0.66% of max health) in 0.33-second intervals (before reductions), starting 0.33 seconds when toggled on.

off, the ability still heals and drains mana for seconds before stopping. the ability toggles off if witch doctor does not have enough mana to support another heal instance. however, the lingering buff continues healing, despite the lack of mana, providing up to 2 possible heal instances for free. neither affect invulnerable nor hidden units. fully affect ally couriers. maledict link link link

witch doctor. checks the affected units' current health 4 times, once as the curse is applied, and then every 4 seconds for the duration. the burst damage is based on the difference between the hero's current health and its health as maledict is applied. this means the bigger the difference between current health and health upon receiving the debuff gets, the more damage the bursts do. vice versa, the lower the difference gets, the lower the burst damage. therefore, getting healed during it reduces its damage. it also means it does not matter how affected units lose health, as it directly compares its health values, not damage values. this is how much of the lost health is re-dealt as spell damage by maledict, depending on when the health was lost during maledict on each level (before reductions): 0 3.9s: 48%/72%/97%/121% ( 124%/148%/172%/196%) 3.9s 7.9s: 32%/48%/64%/80% ( 82%/98%/115%/131%) 7.9s 11.9s: 16%/24%/32%/40% ( 41%/49%/57%/65%) the damage per second component deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after the debuff is applied, resulting in 12 damage instances. together with the bursts, it deals a total of 15 damage instances. the bursts happen 0.1 seconds before each 4th damage tick, so the bursts happen after the 3rd, 7th, and 11th damage tick. with no other sources of health loss or heals, maledict can deal up to 188.5/320.9/483.6/680.2 ( 276/463.8/690/959) damage to a unit (before reductions). the debuff can be placed on illusions and creep-heroes. successive casts neither update the damage values nor damage intervals, but refresh its duration. affects invisible units and units in the fog of war. neither affects invulnerable nor hidden units. voodoo switcheroo link dw abilityno target affectsself / enemies damagepure turns witch

switcheroo cannot be canceled prematurely and always lasts for the full duration unless witch doctor dies during it. the death ward has its attack speed reduced by 40, attacking slower than a regular

secondary targets. the death ward can be controlled to attack a specific target or to stop attacking altogether. both the attacks and the bouncing attacks of the death ward prioritize heroes when choosing its primary target. neither attacks nor bounces to ward-type units and buildings. the projectile's damage on the primary target has the following properties: deals pure attack damage based on the current level sourced to the death ward itself. the damage can trigger attack modifier and on-hit effects, but does not ignore evasion. death ward can target or the projectiles may fire toward attack immune primary targets despite being fully immune to attack damage. the pure attack damage and spell damage is sourced to the death ward itself, meaning certain on-damage effects (e.g. blade mail) react on the ward rather than on witch doctor. with its 0.22-second attack rate and the max channeling time, the death ward can attack up to a maximum 37 times. can deal up to 295.45/454.55/613.64 ( 500/659.09/818.18) damage per second to a single hero. can deal up to 2405/3700/4995 ( 4070/5365/6660) damage (before reductions) to a single hero for the entire duration. attacks from the death ward have a percentage-based accuracy, which prevents its attacks from being missed by 50% from evasion or blind effects. stacks multiplicatively with other outgoing accuracy sources. after the channeling stops or is interrupted, the death ward is now phased and will expire in 5 seconds. during this time, the death ward provides a 5-second 1200 and 800 ground vision at its location. scepter attacks from the death ward now bounce toward the closest enemy units within 650 range and the same projectile can never hit the same unit twice. cannot bounce to invisible units or on units in the fog of war. cannot bounce to attack immune secondary targets. acquiring aghanim's scepter immediately upgrades the current death ward instance. scepter the bouncing projectile's damage has the following properties: does not perform instant attacks. deals a fixed 65/100/135 ( 110/145/180) regular pure spell damage per projectile. the spell damage is neither based on the death ward's attack damage values nor the damage value received on the target. the damage does not trigger any attack modifier or on-hit effects and ignore evasion.

[?]modifier_viper_poison_attackundispellable modifier_viper_poison_attack_slowanyability draft notes: uses the caster's current attack range when autocast.manually casting it uses the cast range. the netherdrake's inborn toxic breath quickly drains the vitality of its afflicted. poison attack's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. it is not affected by cast range bonuses. since poison attack grants attack range bonus while active, both autocast and manually casting it uses viper's current attack range. poison attack places one debuff on the target, successive attacks increase its stack count, and resets the duration of the entire stack. does not work against allied units or wards. the number of stacks can be seen on the status buff icon as well. with 5 ( 7) stacks, it reduces the enemy target's movement speed by 15%/30%/45%/60% ( 21%/42%/63%/84%). talent the movement speed slow increasing talent further increases the movement speed reduction to 18%/36%/54%/72% ( 25.2%/50.4%/75.6%/100.8%). for how much magic resistance reduction, damage per second and total damage (before reductions) poison attack deals with a certain amount of stacks on each level, please refer to the chart below. the magic resistance reduction of poison attack stacks additively by itself. however, it stacks multiplicatively with other magic resistance sources. with max stacks, it reduces most heroes' magic resistance to 10%/2.5%/-5%/-12.5% ( 4%/-6.5%/-17%/-27.5%). talent the magic resistance reduction increasing talent further reduces the value to -5%/-12.5%/-20%/-27.5% ( -17%/-27.5%/-38%/-48.5%). deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after the debuff is applied, resulting in 4 damage instances. with max stacks, poison attack can deal up to 20/40/60/80 ( 28/56/84/112) damage per second, and a total of 80/160/240/320 ( 112/224/336/448) against enemy units in 4 seconds. talent with the damage per second increasing talent, it can deal up to 24/48/72/96 ( 33.6/67.2/100.8/134.4) damage per second, and a total of 96/192/288/384 ( 134.4/268.8/403.2/537.6) against enemy units. the attacks first apply the debuff, then their own damage. shard poison attack now reduces armor and also applies its effects on buildings as well. reduces armor by 1/2/3/4/5/6/7 per stack. with max stacks, poison attack reduces all affected buildings' total magic resistance to -28%/-42%/-56%/-70% ( -56%/-70%/-84%/-98%) this means it can deal up to 14.34/31.81/52.42/76.16 ( 17.47/38.08/61.82/88.7) damage per second to buildings. nethertoxin link link link wr abilitytarget area affectsenemies damagemagical viper releases a nethertoxin at the targeted area. units in that area take an increasing damage over time based

0.5 seconds after receiving the debuff, resulting in up to 14/15/16/17 instances. the damage increases by 1.25/2.81/4.38/5.94 for each 0.5 seconds spent within the area. since both the minimum and maximum value of the damage per interval are increased evenly by 40, the damage increase per interval above remains the same. as the damage increases per interval, and once it reaches the maximum

chart below. the damage value resets whenever the enemy leaves the radius and enters it again. it does not count accumulated time spent within the radius. leveling up the ability or the damage increasing talent does not update the damage of already placed debuffs. however, if the debuff is applied after leveling the ability or the talent, the affected enemy takes the new damage values. multiple instances of nethertoxin's debuff do not stack. corrosive skin link ee abilitypassive affectsself / enemies damagemagical (no-reflection) viper exudes an infectious toxin that damages and

range increasing effects increase the link break distance as well. always heals for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much damage the target actually takes. spirit siphon first deals the damage, then applies the self heal. deals damage and heals for 6.25/12.5/18.75/25 ( 13.75/20/26.25/32.5) in 0.25-second intervals, starting 0.25 seconds after cast, resulting in 24 instances. can damage and heal up to 150/300/450/600 ( 330/480/630/780) when the link lasts its full duration (before reductions). cannot be cast on units that already are affected by spirit siphon, unless the debuff is dispeled. cannot be cast on roshan. successive links place a new buff on death prophet. this means their damage, damage intervals, self-heal values, and durations are independent of each other. does not provide vision over the target. however, the link does not break upon losing vision. when losing vision over the target, the link visually draws to the location where the target was seen last time. scepter spawns 1 exorcism spirit upon cast, prioritizing the linked target. if exorcism is not leveled, no spirits are spawned. shard spirit siphon now applies fear on the target on the 3rd second of the link's duration. the fear relies on the link buff on death prophet, and not on the debuff on the target, so even if the debuff gets dispelled, the fear is still applied. cannot apply the fear if the target is invulnerable or hidden on the 3rd second. spirit siphon's fear makes affected enemies run away from the caster and preventing them from acting. talent the damage and

modifier_death_prophet_scepterdeath modifier_death_prophet_slowanyability draft notes: exorcism passive spirit spawns only work with the drafting hero's attacks, crypt swarm, silence and spirit siphon. over time, the banshee remnants of her previous lives return to haunt the present. the spirits are spawned from death prophet in 0.35-second intervals, starting immediately on cast, taking 2.45/5.25/8.05 ( 5.25/8.05/10.85) seconds for all spirits to be released. the spirits are not units and cannot be interacted with, or affected by anything in any way. spirits move at a speed of 525, roam around, and automatically attack nearby enemies within the 700 radius around death prophet. the spirits acquisition radius is neither affected by cast range nor attack range increasing sources. they can only turn by moving in 150 radius arcs. spirits choose their target randomly but have the following priorities: units death prophet is currently attacking units nearest to death prophet units within the radius. once having chosen a target, a spirit sticks to that target until the target dies, gets out of range, or until death prophet starts attacking a new target. a spirit's ongoing chase cannot be canceled. a spirit only stops chasing its target after reaching it, or when the distance gets greater than 1900. although chasing for much further, the spirits cannot damage units which are 1200 range away from death prophet. after each attack, the spirits need to return to death prophet before being able to attack again. the spirits deal damage on every attackable enemy unit upon reaching them, including buildings, wards, and units inside the fog of war. does not affect the following units: invisible units. ward-type units that require a fixed amount of attacks to destroy. undying zombies. invulnerable or ethereal units, but will continue to deal damage to the target if it turns invulnerable or ethereal after being acquired as a target. the damage is applied as spell damage in a separate damage instance, it is affected by spell damage amplification and works with spell lifesteal. it does not trigger any on-attack effects, ignoring evasion and damage block. outposts are considered valid targets despite not being attackable. couriers have the lowest target priority, they are only damaged if there are no other valid targets within range. when a spirit gets 2000 range away from death prophet, it disappears and then respawns from death prophet. reappearing spirits are still bound to the spawn interval, so when multiple spirits disappear, they do not reappear simultaneously on death prophet. the spirits heal death prophet upon returning once exorcism's duration is up. they do not heal her upon returning after each attack. always heals for the full amount based on their damage value, regardless of how much damage the target actually takes. this means upon having fully returned, a spirit heals death prophet by 15.5 16.75 ( 7.75 8.375) health per attack. grants a total of 1204%/1608%/32% movement speed bonus while active. successive casts cause the previous cast to end prematurely, making the spirits start returning to death prophet and heal her. scepter the passive spirits spawn only work with death prophet's abilities. it does not react to items cast or other abilities. a spirit also spawns on every successful attack or instant attack on a target, including buildings. does not spawn spirits when attacking wards and ally units. these passive spirits behave like the spirits from a regular cast, meaning they still use the max distances and have the same movement behaviors. they can chase their targets for up to 20 seconds before giving up and returning to death prophet. scepter the passive spirits deal 93 101 ( 47 50) damage, and therefore also heal for 23 25 health upon returning. the aghanim's scepter upgrade does not increase the spirit's damage of an active cast.

in front of dazzle, and not at the primary target's position. targets within the cone area are not chosen randomly. it chooses the closest valid targets to the primary target within the cone. deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting immediately, resulting in 6/7/8/9 damage instances when not refreshed. can deal up to 96/196/320/468 ( 456/616/800/1008) damage to each target when not refreshed (before reductions). the duration, damage, and movement speed slow values are updated and refreshed to the current ability level whenever dazzle successfully lands an attack on the debuffed unit, missed attacks do not refresh it. this has no stack limit. only the caster's attacks can refresh and extend the duration of all current applied poison touch debuffs. attacks from other player-controlled units do not refresh the debuff. poison touch of different sources are independent of each other. successive casts of poison touch fully stack with each instance having its independent damage intervals, movement speed slow, and duration. both leveling the ability and the damage per second increasing talent immediately update the current active damage instances. however, both leveling the ability and the movement speed slow increasing talent does not update the current active instances. for how much damage movement speed one instance of poison touch reduces when refreshed, with the movement speed slow increasing talent, please refer to the chart below. shard enemies are now hexed upon projectile impact, setting their base movement speed to 100, silencing, muting and disarming them. the ability upgrade is determined if the caster has aghanim's shard upon projectile hit. both the hex and poison touch debuff are independent of each other but applied at the same time. the hex is only applied once upon projectile impact. therefore, the target is still slowed for 3.4/4.4/5.4/6.4 seconds after the hex duration. hex instantly destroys illusions. treat strong illusions as heroes. poison touch first applies its main debuff, then the hex debuff. talent with the poison touch attack range bonus talent, dazzle has a total of 875 attack range against affected targets. grants dazzle attack range bonus as long as he attacks the affected unit, regardless of its source. does not work against illusions. shallow grave link wg abilitytarget unit

health prevents the affected target's current from dropping below 1 while active. this means the target cannot die to any incoming damage instances, not even damage flagged as hp removal. however, it does not manipulate the value of the incoming damage instance and fully procs on-damage effects. shallow grave prevents the target from dying to the following sources: ice blast's kill threshold. false promise's delayed damage. instant kill sources applied to illusions. does not protect the targets against the following sources: culling blade's kill threshold. wraith delay expiring. forced kill sources applied to the target, while affected by shallow grave. shallow grave can be dispelled by the following sources, despite being dispellable only by death: supernova dismember treats clones, illusions and creep-heroes as heroes. the halo ability effect appears at 190/240/300/350 range above the affected target, indicating its remaining duration, and it hits the ground right when the effect expires. grants incoming heal amplification. neither grants health regen amplification, lifesteal amplification or spell lifesteal amplification. all healing the target receives is amplified, regardless of the source. the incoming heal amplification bonus increases by 1.8%/3.6%/5.4%/7.2% for every 10% of max health missing, reaching 18%/36%/54%/72% when below 10% max health. the health percentage is checked periodically and the effects are adapted instantly. talent the heal on shallow grave end talent heals the target for 200 health upon losing the buff in any way. therefore, this healing is not affected by shallow grave's own heal amplification. successive buffs of multiple shallow grave do not instantly apply the heal. shadow wave link ed abilitytarget unit affectsallies

and heal nearby allies equal to 150% of the normal healing and damage values. dazzle will also perform an attack against any enemy that shadow wave bounces to. while it is a simplistic and routine rite among shadow priests, the shadow wave is also the most critical for success. shadow wave damage and heal visualized. shadow wave has no bounce delay, all targets are healed simultaneously. shadow wave has the following priorities on allies and on enemies: hurt heroes hurt non-hero units (including illusions) heroes non-hero units. the lower the health of the unit, the higher their priority. this means the lowest health units get healed first. if multiple units meet the same criteria (e.g. when only full health non-hero units are within range), it chooses between them randomly. fully heal and consider invulnerable allies and ally couriers as valid targets. regardless of the target, dazzle is always healed without counting towards the number of bounces, effectively healing 4/5/6/7 units. double-tapping automatically targets self. can heal and damage up to 300/475/690/945 ( 480/700/960/1260) health when all bounces hit (before reductions). the damage radius is centered around each healed unit. an enemy unit can get damaged by all healed units per cast. shadow wave first applies the heal on affected allies, then the damage on affected enemies. scepter adds enemy unit-targeting functionality and can now target enemies following the same priority and other ability notes as above. can instant attack and bounce to invisible enemies and enemies in the fog of war. scepter the heal and damage multiplier now applies whenever shadow wave hits an enemy unit. when shadow wave hits an enemy unit, it now applies the increased damage on affected enemies, the increased heal on affected allies, the heal on affected allies, the damage on affected enemies, then the instant attack on all hit enemies. this effectively deals 2.5 times the damage to enemies, while healing allies for the same amount when the shadow wave cast hit enemies. can heal and damage up to 750/1187.5/1725/2362.5 ( 1200/1750/2400/3150) health when all bounces hit (before reductions). scepter dazzle now also instantly attacks all enemy units affected by shadow wave. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. they do not have true strike, but completely ignore disarms. does not attack wards and undying zombies. for melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss. bad juju link link rw

component is not limited to dazzle's abilities. all chakra magic current cooldown notes fully apply. each invocation of the nothl realm helps it further permeate the surroundings of our own. bad juju's passive component only works with dazzle's abilities. it does not react to items or other abilities. bad juju always applies its stack before the triggering ability applies any of its effects, including casting bad juju itself. poison touch applies a stack on enemies on projectile hit. shallow grave applies a stack on the targeted ally upon cast. shadow wave applies a stack per instance of heal and damage on all healed allies, including dazzle, and on all damaged enemies respectively. enemies that are within the damage radius of multiple healed allies receive multiple stacks as well. bad juju first increases the stack by 1 upon cast, then reduces the current cooldown of dazzle's abilities by a flat amount. fully affects all basic abilities, including passive abilities. does not affect item abilities at all. (as of 7.35b, it still effects cooldowns of tp scroll and neutral items) all armor stacks work fully independently from each other. they do not refresh each other but share a status buff. fully affect couriers, but not roshan. the health cost for this ability is expr 75 1.4 ^ debuffstack of dazzle's current health rounded down. current health as cost is considered as setting health and it is non-lethal. therefore, this ability can be cast even with 1 health. the health cost tooltip displays the momentary health cost based on the current health, and updates whenever the tooltip is called. each stack places a new debuff on dazzle. this means their durations are independent of each other. the current number of both armor stacks and health cost increase stacks are visible on the modifier's icon and in its description. successive casts up to 5 times cost up to 75/105/146/205/288 current health.

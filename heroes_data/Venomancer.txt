 Spell Immunity Poison Sting



 Plague Wards can be controlled to attack a specific target or to stop attacking altogether.
Plague Wards' attacks apply  Poison Sting based on its current level on enemies as well.
Poison Sting notes fully apply.
The damage source of the wards' Poison Sting is Venomancer, meaning certain on-damage effects (e.g.  Damage Return) react on the Venomancer rather than on the wards.
Leveling up ability and learning the health regeneration reduction  talent immediately update all current active Plague Wards' Poison Sting ability values.
The wards' attack damage is not reduced by damage block.
Plague Wards have a lower target priority than units and heroes, so they are attacked by towers and lane creeps last.
 Roshan always prioritizes wards if there are no other units within his attack range. He also destroys Plague Wards with 100 attack.
The wards gain their spell immunity through a buff, so it is possible for enemies to ‼ Ping it to display its remaining duration.
TALENT The Plague Wards health and damage multiplier  talent does not immediately update current active Plague Wards.
SPELL STEAL  Poison Sting applied is based on  Venomancer's current ability level when acquired. Latent Toxicity  Link▶️Link▶️DL

modifier_nyx_assassin_impalestrongall zealot scarabs possess intimate knowledge of underground pathways, using them to their advantage. the spikes travel at a speed of 1600. with the travel distance and radius, impale can hit units up to 890 range away. hit units are knocked up 350 range for the initial 0.5 seconds of the stun. while in the air, other units may pass below hit airborne units. the spike that hits the target releases some dust particles. this visual effect can also be seen in the fog of war. when impale hits invisible units, the visual effects below the hit unit are still visible. impale first applies the damage, then the debuff. scepter while burrowed, impale can be cast without having to face the targeted point or unit. with the travel distance increase, impale can now hit units up to 1415 range away. does not reset the ability's cooldown if cast before burrowed. shard can deal up to 117/187.2/257.4/327.6 ( 257.4/327.6/397.8/468) damage with the vendetta debuff

modifier_nyx_assassin_jolt_damage_trackerundispellablethe tome in ultimyr describes one scarab with the ability to eat away at the minds of lesser beings. places a damage counter on all heroes upon learning the ability, including nyx itself. the damage counter accumulates all damage instances from all damage types the target received within the last 15 seconds, then it is dealt as another single spell damage instance to the mind flare target. does not accumulate damage from the following sources: damage flagged as hp removal. damage sources with the no-reflection flag (e.g. blade mail). the damage counter resets once the ability is cast. therefore, subsequent casts only count damage dealt since the last time the ability was cast, including the bonus damage instance from mind flare. can be cast on units without intelligence points (e.g. creep-heroes and ogre magi), dealing just the damage bonus. scepter while burrowed, mind flare can be cast without having to face the targeted point or unit. shard increases the intelligence as damage multiplier to 4.1/4.68/5.27/5.85 ( 7.61/8.19/8.78/9.36) + 29.25% damage bonus with the vendetta debuff (before reductions). talent the area of

over a unit, the area of effect talent fully affects all units within radius around both targets. spiked carapace link link ed abilityno target affectsenemies damagesource type(no-reflection) when

modifier_stunnedstrongwhile their carapaces are relatively thin, they're guarded by a retractable field of razor-sharp spikes. interrupts nyx assassin's channeling abilities upon cast. can be cast without breaking the invisibility of vendetta, but not other invisibility sources. successive casts do not stack but refresh its duration. only reflects player-based damage directly toward the damage dealer. a unit can only be affected once per buff. reflects incoming damage before all manipulations. however, damage manipulation on the enemy still affects the damage normally. reflects the same damage type as received. reflected magical damage is affected by damage block as well. the reflected damage has the following flags: no-reflection flag, preventing its damage from interacting with other sources of damage with the same flag. uses the same modifier as blade mail, damage returned from the item's active and passive ability deal instances of 0 damage while spiked carapace is active. fully procs on-damage effects on enemies, except those which have a minimum damage threshold (e.g. gravekeeper's cloak). no-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing its damage from utilizing spell lifesteal. no-spell-amplification flag, preventing its damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification. returns one instance of the same damage type as received to the source. has a global reflect range and affects units through both fog of war and invisibility. does not return self-inflicted damage and damage flagged as hp removal. spiked carapace first applies the debuff, then the reflected damage. for nyx, spiked carapace fully negates and reflects the damage instance after all reductions, causing several on-damage effects to not trigger. however, it neither prevents death nor instant kill sources from triggering. spiked carapace has priority over damage barriers, negating the damage before it gets absorbed by the barriers. although the damage reflected to enemies is equal to the amount of damage blocked, the effects work independently from each other. this means spiked carapace always blocks one damage instance, even when the source is invulnerable. does not work against wards, buildings, creeps and ally units. scepter while burrowed, casting spiked carapace immediately stuns all enemies within radius. since spiked carapace has no base damage, hit units are not damaged upon cast. fully affects lane creeps and neutral creeps. nyx assassin still receives the cast buff normally, which can still reflect damage and stun enemies. enemy units stunned by spiked carapace this way do not trigger and cannot be affected by the damage-reflected component again. burrow link df abilityno target affectsself nyx assassin buries himself beneath the battlefield over a short duration. once burrowed, spiked carapace instantly stuns nearby enemies when cast, the range of mind flare and impale is increased, and impale's cooldown is decreased. while burrowed, nyx

nyx can pick up, drop or attack items and runes without breaking the invisibility. for ranged heroes, this is upon projectile hit. therefore, the bonus damage will not be applied if another action was

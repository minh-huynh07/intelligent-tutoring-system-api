necrophos turns into a large death pulse towards the target unit's position. once it arrives to the location, the death pulse spreads towards nearby enemies and allies. cast animation: 0.2+0.6cast

unlocked. turns necrophos into a hidden and invulnerable projectile, and periodically drags him along with it at a speed of 900 upon cast. can travel over impassable terrain and through trees. upon reaching the targeted unit's location at the time of casting, death seeker releases a death pulse based on its current level centered around the primary target within 500 radius. the primary affected target releasing the projectiles is also affected by death pulse, and the secondary projectiles travel at a speed of 400. other death pulse notes fully apply. if death pulse is not learned, no projectile is released upon cast. if the target is invulnerable or hidden on impact, the death pulse is not released. spell steal death pulse released is based on necrophos' current ability level when acquired. soulbind launches two projectiles simultaneously to both targets, necrophos appears next to the secondary target. reaper's scythe link rr abilitytarget unit affectsenemy heroes / self

power of the necrophos's plague magic. the damage is calculated and dealt to the target at the end of the stun duration. the stun duration is unaffected by status resistance. deals enough damage (before reductions) to kill the target when it is at 41%/44%/47% of max health. shares one instance of 0 damage when triggering damage shared sources (e.g. fatal bonds). reaper's scythe has the highest priority in the group of kill credit manipulation effects. all damage dealt to the affected target, including from allies, during the stun duration is sourced to reaper's scythe, and credited to necrophos. this means when combined with other kill credit manipulation effects (e.g. winter's curse), the kill credit is still given to necrophos. however, the following conditions do not credit necrophos with the kill credit: when spirit bear is instantly killed due to its owner dying while affected by reaper's scythe, without the return upgrade. when the affected target is brought into supernova during the stun duration. when the affected target is swallowed by dismember during the stun duration and is not ejected when the damage is dealt. when the affected target is affected by a reflected omnislash or swiftslash. in the case of swiftslash, it must still be occuring when the damage is dealt. forced kill sources applied to the affected target during the stun duration. grants necrophos a stack as long as he was credited for the kill. grants a stack even if the dying hero has reincarnation, or killing illusions and creep-heroes, but not from the tempest double or the spirit bear. the number of stacks gained can be seen on the status buff icon. the current health and mana regeneration bonus can be seen in its description. the health and mana regeneration bonuses granted are not retroactive. all stacks retain their values from when it was first acquired.

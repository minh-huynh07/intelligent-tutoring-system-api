cross leshrac's path. split earth first applies the debuff, then the damage. destroys trees within the affected radius. split earth has no visual or audio indicator during the effect delay. shard split earth now applies its effect 4 times at the targeted point. the first instance still happens 0.35 seconds after cast. the following instances happen 5.35/10.35/15.35 seconds after cast. the visual effect during the delay between the extra instances is visible to everyone. each instance has the following radius: level 1 150/195/240/285 ( 190/235/280/325) level 2 180/225/270/315 (

leshrac with physical explosions that deal physical damage to enemy units and structures. the fewer units available to attack, the more damage those units will take. lasts 10 seconds. cast animation:

one plane to the other, evaporating anything it touches. diabolic edict's radius is centered on and follows leshrac. randomly selects nearby valid units, including buildings, for each explosion. there are no priorities. fully affects invisible units and units in the fog of war. when no valid targets are nearby, the explosions randomly appear within a square with 500 side lengths. these random explosions deal no damage. creates explosions in 0.25 ( 0.15)-second intervals, starting immediately as the ability is cast, resulting in 40 ( 65) explosions. can deal up to 400/720/1040/1360 ( 650/1170/1690/2210) damage (before reductions) to a single target. successive casts of diabolic edict fully stack, with each cast creating its own independent instance. when leshrac dies, the explosions still occur at his death location. lightning storm link eg abilitytarget unit affectsenemies damagemagical summons a lightning storm that blasts the target enemy unit, then jumps to nearby enemy units. struck units are slowed by 90/140/190/240 for a duration. cast animation: 0.3+1.04cast range: 650jump distance: 475storm instances per unit: 1number of jumps: 5/7/9/11effect delay:

mastery of the elements is evident in the massive storms that strike down armies before him. the lightning hits the initial target after the 0.25-second effect delay and then jumps to other targets in 0.25-second intervals, so hitting all targets takes 1.25/1.75/2.25/2.75 seconds. this means the initial lightning can be avoided by being invulnerable, hidden, or spell immune. however, this does not prevent it from jumping. lightning storm does not jump on to invisible units, or units in the fog of war. the lightning storm buff is a hidden buff required for the lightning to jump. it cannot hit the same unit again per cast. all jumps together can deal up to 450/980/1710/2640 damage (before reductions) per storm instance. successive cast of lightning storm fully stack, with each cast creating its own independent instance. lightning storm first applies the damage, then the debuff. nihilism link link dr abilityno target affectsenemies / self causes leshrac and all nearby enemies to turn ethereal, preventing them from attacking, slowing them, and making them take more magic damage. increases leshrac's speed rather than reducing it. does not cause leshrac to take amplified damage. cast

turns leshrac and all enemies within the radius ethereal, disarming them, rendering them attack immune, and granting 100% physical damage resistance. the ethereal effect on enemies is provided by an aura, its debuff lingers for 0.5 seconds. the magic resistance reduction of multiple ethereal effects does not stack, the one with higher value takes priority. dispelling the buff on leshrac ends the ability prematurely. stacks multiplicatively with other magic resistance sources. reduces most heroes' magic resistance to 2.5%. with the magic resistance reduction from this source, every 10 points of intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 1.3%. [?] successive casts do not stack but refresh the duration. pulse nova link link rv abilitytoggle affectsenemies ( self) damagemagical creates waves of damaging energy around leshrac, one per second, to damage nearby enemy units. drains leshrac's mana with each pulse. cast animation: 0+0radius: 525damage per second: 80/135/180 ( 115/170/215)pulse nova downtime: 1 move speed bonus: 10% damage reduction: 20% auto lightning storm radius: 700 storm interval: 2 number of targets: 1 1 50/60/70 + 25/45/65/ second aghanim's scepter upgrade:new ability grants the nihilism ability. modifiers [?]modifier_leshrac_pulse_novadeath if necessary, the tormented soul can manipulate space time itself, ravaging lesser beings. does not interrupt leshrac's channeling abilities upon toggling on / off. if toggled on, pulse nova continues working even when silenced, disabled, or hidden. when toggled off, pulse nova goes on a fixed 1-second cooldown. this cooldown can be reset with cooldown resetting abilities, but it is not affected by percentage-based cooldown reductions. drains 25/45/65 mana in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second upon activation. however, pulse nova deals its damage immediately upon activation. fully affects invisible units and units in the fog of war. talent applies generic incoming damage reduction on leshrac while active. stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation. reduces all damage types leshrac receives, except from damage flagged as hp removal (e.g. sunder). the pulse nova lightning storm talent passively triggers a single lightning storm strike on a random unit within 700 radius, prioritizing heroes. treat illusions and clones as heroes, creep-heroes as creeps. the auto lightning storm strike uses fixed replenish time and is not affected by any cooldown reduction sources. once a strike happens, the effect has to recharge for 2 seconds. does not strike invisible units or units hidden in the fog of war.

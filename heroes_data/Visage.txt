familiars and does not affect any other player-controlled units. the warmth of the sun is never felt in the dark cold of the narrow maze. the slow and speed bonus values are independent from each other. upon cast, visage gains movement speed based on his current movement speed while the affected target loses movement speed based on theirs. the same applies to the attack speed bonus and its reduction. this also means when either visage or the target loses the buff/debuff, the other still keeps theirs. the buff is also independently applied to familiars within 900 range of visage. dispelling visage does not remove the buff on the familiars. the buff is applied even while they are invulnerable (i.e. stone form), but not when hidden. this buff is not applied to other player-controlled units. since the buff is not aura-based, familiars can move away from visage and still keep the buff after grave chill is cast. soul assumption link link wc abilitytarget unit

[?]modifier_visage_soul_assumptionundispellable the collected souls of the dead reach out to bring another into their fold. the projectile travels at a speed of 1000. each instance of damage taken by heroes within 1800 radius is saved for 6 seconds or until soul assumption is cast. when the sum of the saved damage exceeds 100 damage, a charge is added. a total of 300/400/500/600 damage is needed, within the radius in the last 6 seconds to reach the maximum amount of charges. counts damage values of all 3 damage types between 2 3000 (after reductions) that is dealt by player-controlled units and roshan to heroes and clones. does not count self-inflicted damage (e.g. mist coil), damage flagged as hp removal (e.g. soul ring), and from illusions and creep-heroes. the number of current charges is visible in the form of yellow bars above visage. this is visible to visage and his allies only. upon cast, soul assumption's damage is set and the charges counter is reset upon projectile launch. the projectile's visual appearance also reflects the number of charges, revealing how much damage it is approximately about to deal. with 0/1/2/3/4/5/6 charges, soul assumption can deal 20/90/160/230/300/370/440 ( 20/115/210/305/400/495/590) damage to the target (before reductions). talent the soul assumption multishot talent launches 1 additional projectile towards random visible valid targets within the range. with the cast range and the range buffer, the ability has a search range of 1300. cannot target the primary target with the additional projectile, so when no other targets are nearby, nothing happens. the secondary target is chosen randomly within the area, with heroes (including illusions and clones) being prioritized. treats creep-heroes as creeps. since the additional projectile uses the ability's cast range, cast range increasing effects increase its range as well. gravekeeper's cloak link link ev abilitypassive ( no target) affectsself (familiars)(

visage. stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation. affects all damage types visage receives. only reduces player-based damage greater than 40 (after all other reductions). neither reduces damage flagged as hp removal nor self-damage sources. upon learning, 4 floating stones appear around visage, indicating the number of layers he has. a stone disappears for each missing layer. the number of layers can be seen on the status buff icon as well. the recharge time for each layer is independent of all others. multiple layers can recharge at once if they are removed quickly enough. damage dealt to familiars does not remove layers. with 4 layers, the damage reduction is hard capped at 32%/48%/64%/80%. for how much damage reduction is granted per layer, please refer to the chart below. the aura also affects all familiars under visage's control, granting them damage reduction based on the current charges on visage. the buff lingers for 0.5 seconds. unlike the damage reduction on visage, this damage reduction has no minimum threshold, reducing all damage they take. the buff is applied even while they are invulnerable (i.e. stone form), but not when hidden. this buff is not applied to other player-controlled units. talent the gravekeeper's cloak armor talent also grants armor to the familiars. visage receives this armor bonus from the ability's passive modifier since the aura only affects familiars. shard adds an active component to gravekeeper's cloak, with the passive effects still present. except for the health regeneration values, the other values are taken from familiars' stone form, based on the current level of summon familiars. can regenerate 4.17% of visage's max health per second over the duration. stone form

in ability draft. this is innate to visage and does not need to be learned. does not interrupt visage's channeling abilities upon cast. this ability is disabled when no familiar has stone form ready. the ability goes on a cooldown equal to the cooldown time of the stone form with the lowest cooldown among all familiars. the cooldown is not affected by any cooldown reduction and cooldown resets sources, it periodically updates itself to match the next lowest stone form cooldown. this means re-casting summon familiars while the sub-ability is on cooldown, stone form is instantly ready to be cast again. upon cast, it orders the closest familiar to enter stone form automatically. familiars entering stone form via this sub-ability do not trigger on-cast effects. if the familiar is stunned, silenced, sleeping, hidden, taunted, feared, or hypnotized, it cannot be made to enter stone form. this ability can be cast when visage is stunned, cycloned, sleeping, taunted, hidden, or during forced movement. however, he cannot use this ability while silenced, hexed or prevented from acting. visage is unable to shift-queue this ability. spell steal this ability is not acquirable. silent as

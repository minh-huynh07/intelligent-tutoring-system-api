aether remnant's search area (red) and vision area (yellow). the remnant moves towards the targeted point at a speed of 900. upon reaching the targeted point, the remnant faces towards the targeted direction, and then remains inactive for 0.4 seconds. after the activation delay, the remnant provides flying vision in front of it. the vision is provided by 2 vision cells, each with a radius of 200. the first vision cell is positioned 225 range in front of the remnant, the second one 450 range in front of it. the remnant itself also has 250 radius ground vision and 475 radius true sight. this is the dummy's vision, provided at all times around the remnant. together with the remnant's own vision, the total vision area has a length of 925, and a width of 450. talent the remnant true sight talent does not update exisiting aether remnants. after the activation delay, the remnant searches for enemies within a path in front of it. the search path has a length of 450 ( 600) and width of 130. when multiple enemies are within the area, it grabs the one furthest away closest to the center line. treats illusions, clones, summons and creep-heroes as heroes. applies a hypnotizing fear and provides true sight over the target, pulling it towards the remnant, and prevents it from acting. sets the target's movement speed to 44%/50%/56%/62% of the distance between remnant and the target. if the target is too close, it stops moving once within 100 range of the remnant. when cast at maximum cast range, this results in a speed of 330/312.5/300/290.63. grants the target unobstructed pathing, so they can move through cliffs, trees, and other units while walking towards the remnant. for creeps, the remnant applies the damage right after the activation delay. although the fear is applied, it is not noticeable. shard the remnant now does not disappear when affecting creeps but still disappears once affecting enemy heroes. the speed is set once upon cast. if the target gets moved or teleported, the speed does not adapt. aether remnant first applies the damage, the pull debuff, then the damage debuff on creeps. destroys trees within a 200 radius around the target at the end of the fear. shard for creeps, the remnant now also applies a 1-second debuff on enemy creeps within the area. the debuff deals one damage instance immediately upon application on enemy creeps without the debuff. the debuff neither stacks nor refreshes itself, it is reapplied on valid enemy creeps once its previous debuff duration ends. this results in a maximum of 20 damage instances when standing within the area for the full duration. one instance of the debuff can deal up to 21/36/51/66 ( 36/51/66/81) damage (before reductions). can deal up to a total of 420/720/1020/1320 ( 720/1020/1320/1620) damage to a single unit for the entire duration (before reductions). dissimilate link link wd abilityno target affectsself / enemies damagemagical void spirit temporarily fades into the aether, creating a number of portals through which he can reassemble himself. upon exiting a portal, he damages all enemies in the area. cast animation: 0.3+0portals radius:

[?]modifier_void_spirit_dissimilate_phasedeath modifier_rootedanyinai much prefers to observe our plane free from the confines of corporeal form. dissimilate's portal formation. creates 7 ( 13) portals, with one of them being at the cast location. the following 6 portals form a ring around the center portal, with their center being 520 range far away from it. one portal is created in front of void spirit, while the other 6 are adapted to it, with 60 angles between them, forming a hexagon. talent with the outer ring talent, the last 6 portals are placed in line behind the portals of the first ring. these last portals are 1040 range away from the center portal and are placed using the same angles as the portals of the first ring. turns void spirit invulnerable and hidden for its duration. fully disables, silences, mutes, roots, and disarms void spirit, making him unable to do anything. however, void spirit can still pick up items or activate runes at the cast location. void spirit can decide at which portal to reappear, by issuing a move order ( right click or m). directly clicking on the portals is not required, a directional order is enough. the closest portal to the right-clicked location gets selected. attack orders behave like move orders during disarms, so right-clicking an enemy also selects the nearest portal to the enemy. void spirit can change the selected portals as many times as he wants while hidden. a selected portal is highlighted for void spirit and his allies. for enemies, all portals look the same. does not grant phased movement, void spirit can still block other units during dissimilate. does not disjoint projectiles upon teleporting. talent with the dissimlate roots talent, the damage and the 2-second root is dealt around the selected portal upon re-appearing. dissimilate first apply the damage, then the root. resonant pulse link link link ee abilityno target affectsself / enemies damagemagical void spirit wraps himself in a protective shield that absorbs physical damage and emits a single damaging pulse around him. the shield gains increased damage absorption for each enemy hero the pulse hits. cast animation: 0+0radius:

scepter upgrade: causes resonant pulse to silence and gain charges. modifiers [?]modifier_void_spirit_resonant_pulse_ringdeath modifier_void_spirit_resonant_pulse_physical_buffany modifier_silenceanyinai never hesitates to shroud himself in the essence of his true self when forced to interact with the mortal plane. interrupts void spirit's channeling abilities upon cast. resonant pulse is a thin ring expanding outwards at a speed of 1200, taking 0.42 seconds to reach maximum range and dissipate. it can be avoided by teleporting towards void spirit over the ring shortly after cast. enemy units hit by the ring are damaged and release a projectile toward void spirit. these projectiles travel at a speed of 900 and cannot be disjointed. once the projectiles reach void spirit, they increase the physical damage barrier by 40/60/80/100. while active, if the base value is depleted before these projectiles reach, they create a new shield, with their own capacity. the pulse is bound to a modifier. multiple instances of the modifier stack, so that each cast releases a ring. the modifier is lost upon dying, therefore upon death stops the ring. grants void spirit a physical damage barrier that absorbs physical attack damage values, causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity. does not absorb spell damage of any damage types. stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources. has a higher priority than universal damage barriers in the group of damage barriers. however, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g. refraction), resonant pulse does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire. can grant up the following damage barrier capacity per hit hero: 1x hero: 80/140/200/260 2x hero: 120/200/280/360 3x hero: 160/260/360/460 4x hero: 200/320/440/560 5x hero: 240/380/520/660 treats clones as heroes, illusions and creep-heroes as creeps. scepter resonance pulse first applies the damage, then the silence debuff. goes on a 0.25-second cooldown when cast to prevent accidental double-casts. acquiring aghanim's scepter instantly grants 1 extra charges. this only happens once, re-acquiring it does not grant another 1 charge. astral step link rt abilitytarget point affectsenemies / self damage instant attack / magical void spirit tears a rift through the astral plane to appear at the target location, attacking all enemies along the path. this attack inflicts a void mark that slows for

on the mortal plane. void spirit is teleported instantly towards the targeted point upon cast. does not disjoint projectiles upon teleporting. astral step first applies the instant attack, the debuff, then the debuff damage. causes void spirit to perform an instant attack on every enemy unit along the path. fully affect couriers. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally, except for cleave. they have true strike, and completely ignore disarms. talent the critical strike talent adds an ensured 140% critical strike to the instant attack as well. if two sources of critical strike proc at the same time, the higher crit multiplier has priority. all hit enemies also receive the movement speed slow debuff. this debuff deals damage upon losing it. this means dispelling it causes the damage to happen earlier. multiple instances of the debuff fully stack and work independently from each other.

A now-mastered relic from his childhood, Pugna delights in banishing others into the Nether Realm, whether for good, evil, or simple enjoyment.


Does not interrupt Pugna's channeling abilities upon cast.
While channeling, Decrepify has an  instant cast time, does not require facing the target to cast, and can be cast on untargetable units.
Turns the enemy target ethereal, disarming them, rendering them attack immune, and granting 100% physical damage resistance.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
Cannot be cast on allies who have ☐ Disabled Help from Pugna.
The magic resistance reduction of multiple ethereal effects does not stack, the one with higher value takes priority.
However, the movement speed slow does stack with other movement speed slow sources, including Decrepify itself.
Successive casts on the same target update the ability values of the current instance, with the latter cast overriding the previous cast, regardless of factions.
Can be cast on ally  Nether Wards and  Tombstones, but not enemy ones.
Cannot be cast on any other wards.
Grants 10%/15%/20%/25% incoming heal amplification and does not slow allied targets.
Stacks multiplicatively with other heal amplification sources.
Does not grant other restoration manipulations.
Increases  Life Drain health restore per second and mana restore on full health up to the following values per Decrepify level:
LEVEL 1  132/231/330 ( 158.4/277.2/396) and  66/115.5/165 ( 79.2/138.6/198)
LEVEL 2  138/241.5/345 ( 165.6/289.8/414) and  69/120.75/172.5 ( 82.8/144.9/207)
LEVEL 3  144/252/360 ( 172.8/302.4/432) and  72/126/180 ( 86.4/151.2/216)
LEVEL 4  150/262.5/375 ( 180/315/450) and  75/131.25/187.5 ( 90/157.5/225)

Stacks multiplicatively with other  magic resistance sources.
Reduces most heroes' magic resistance to 2.5%/-5%/-12.5%/-20%.
With the magic resistance reduction from this source, every 10 points of  intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 1.3%/1.4%/1.5%/1.6%. [?] Nether Ward Link▶️Link▶️EW

↓↓ Double-tapping automatically places the  Nether Ward right in front of Pugna, 150 ( 500) range away from him.
Treats attacks from clones as heroes, and attacks from creep-heroes and illusions as creeps.
The aura only affects enemy heroes, including illusions, clones, and creep-heroes.
The damage is independent of the aura, so even though the debuff lingers, Nether Ward cannot damage units beyond 1400 radius.
Unlike the aura, the damage affects every enemy unit and not just heroes.
The damage triggers on every instance of mana usage from abilities. If an ability costs no mana to use, it does not trigger it.
This means if an ability uses mana over time (e.g.  Chakram), the flare triggers on every single instance of mana they use.
The damage does not trigger on mana loss caused by abilities that removes mana offensively (e.g.  Mana Burn or  Mana Break).
Fully ignores abilities that do not trigger on-cast effects (i.e. active attack modifiers and toggle-abilities).
The damage is dealt before the actual ability is cast, so if the target dies to Nether Ward's damage, the ability stays unused.
This means that damage-negating effects with mana cost (e.g.  Refraction) or abilities granting spell immunity with mana cost (e.g.  Rage), do not save the caster if the damage is lethal.
Dying with  Reincarnation ready triggers the damage, but it does not prevent Reincarnation from going off.
The damage source is the ward itself, meaning certain on-damage effects (e.g.  Damage Return) react on the Nether Ward rather than on Pugna.
Fully affects invulnerable and invisible units and units in the Fog of War.
This includes neutral creeps despite not having the debuff on them.
However, it does not deal damage to invulnerable units.
SHARD  Life Drain can now be cast on the Nether Ward, and causes it to refract and be cast on all enemy heroes within  radius of the ward.
Life Drain refracted this way treats illusions and creep-heroes as heroes.
The range uses Life Drain's current cast range and is affected by cast range bonuses.
This only happens once upon cast; enemies entering the refract radius after cast are not affected.
Life Drain can be cast on any Nether Wards, regardless of factions.
Multiple Life Drains from different sources can be cast on the same Nether Ward as well, creating independent Life Drain refractions.
Although Nether Ward is refracting Life Drain, the damage is sourced to its caster, and not to the  Nether Ward.
Therefore, the damage is affected by outgoing damage manipulation and spell lifesteal.
SHARD Life Drain cast this way drains 120/180/240 health per second per affected target.
Can drain up to 1200/1800/2400 health per affected target (before reductions) when fully channeled.
The effect is interrupted when the channeling is canceled or when the Nether Ward is destroyed.
Life Drain and its scepter upgrade notes fully apply.
SCEPTER The refracted Life Drain also grants a stack of 1% spell damage amplification per affected target in 0.25-second intervals, starting 0.25 seconds after cast, resulting in the same amount of instances as its damage instances. Life Drain  Link▶️RD

When cast on an enemy, Pugna drains health from the target enemy unit to heal himself and grant vision over the target. If Pugna has full HP, and the enemy target is a Hero, Life Drain will restore mana instead.When cast on an ally, Pugna will drain his own health into his ally.

Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
Reduces cooldown by 50%. When targeting an enemy hero, Pugna reduces their outgoing spell damage by 8% per second up to a maximum of 75% and increases his own, up to a maximum of 100%. Debuff lasts 8 seconds.

Aghanim's Shard Upgrade:

Life Drain can target your Nether Ward, causing life drain to refract to all enemy heroes within 700 units of the ward for  of its damage. The effect is interrupted if the ward is destroyed.

Debuff Immunity Notes:The damage is always affected, no matter whom it is dealt to.True Sight pierces debuff immunity.Spell Block / Reflection Notes:Fully blocked when primary target.Not blocked when the Life Drain cast is refracted by Nether Ward.Refracted Life Drain casts do not trigger Spell Reflection.Modifiers [?]

modifier_pugna_life_drain_spell_ampDeathPugna has truly become more powerful than even the grandmaster of Oblivion.


The links break when the targets turn invulnerable or hidden, exceed the break distance, or run out of health.
When Pugna turns invisible or is in the Fog of War, Life Drain's particle effects continue to draw toward his last known location for the enemies.
Exposes the affected targets, and provides True Sight over it.
Also provides a 10-second 200 radius ground vision centered on the affected target upon cast. This vision does not follow the affected target and its duration is independent of the channeling time.
Casting Life Drain on ally targets works akin of the ally casting Life Drain on Pugna.
The self-damage when targeting allies is also lethal, so it can be used to deny oneself.
If Pugna's or the ally hero's health is full and one of the damaged unit is a hero, it restores their mana instead.
This means it also restores mana on allied creeps when they are at full health since Pugna (i.e. a hero) is damaged.
Therefore, with spell lifesteal sources on Pugna, he can restore the ally's health and restore his mana at the same time.
The mana restored is neither affected by incoming nor outgoing mana restore manipulation.
Only restores mana to ally heroes.
Treats damaged strong illusions and creep-heroes as creeps.
Can be cast only on ally  Couriers.
Drains 40/60/80 health in 0.25-second intervals, starting 0.25 seconds after cast, resulting in up to 40 instances.
Can drain up to 1600/2400/3200 health (before reductions) when fully channeled.
Always heals for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much damage the target actually takes.
Can heal up to 1200/2100/3000 ( 1440/2520/3600) health when fully channeled.
Can restore up to 60/105/150 ( 72/126/180) mana per second when the affected ally hero is at full health.
Other heal amplification sources (e.g.  Decrepify and the heal increasing  talent) further amplifies the mana restore values on full health.
The color of Life Drain's link changes depending on the situation:
When draining life from an enemy, the link is red ➜ green (pink ➜ blue if Pugna is at full health).
When draining life into an ally, the link is green ➜ green (blue ➜ green if the ally is at full health).
Instantly destroys targeted enemy illusions on the first instance. Allied illusions are not destroyed.
Life Drain first deals damage, applies the heal, then applies its spell damage amplification change on each interval.
SCEPTER Life Drain now applies generic outgoing spell damage reduction on the affected enemy target while applying the same generic outgoing spell damage amplification on Pugna.
Stacks additively with other sources of generic outgoing damage manipulation.
Treats clones as heroes, illusions, and creep-heroes as creeps.
The reduction affects only spell damage enemies deal that is not flagged as HP removal.
Grants a stack of 2% spell damage amplification in 0.25-second intervals, starting 0.25 seconds after cast, resulting in the same amount of instances as its damage instances.
Vice versa, the affected target loses the same amount of spell damage amplification per interval.
Can grant up to 78% spell damage amplification bonus when fully channeled.
Life Drain can only grant up to 100% spell damage amplification bonus to Pugna, while the affected target can only lose up to a flat 75%.
With the spell damage amplification bonus, it can drain up to 2224/3336/4448 health (before reductions) when fully channeled.
SCEPTER Each stack places a new buff/debuff on both Pugna and the affected target and refreshes the buff/debuff duration.
The counter modifiers on both Pugna and his targets show how much spell damage amplification they gained or lost.
Upon death, the dying hero's outgoing spell damage values restore back to their normal values, while Pugna keeps the spell damage amplification values for the remaining duration.
SHARD Multiple Life Drain sources can be cast on any  Nether Wards or the same Nether Ward, regardless of factions.
SOULBIND Life Drain on the primary target ends prematurely when the secondary target is no longer affected by it. However, prematurely ending the channeling on the primary target does not affect the channeling on the other target, even with  Soulbind's leash debuff expired.

the primary target takes two damage instances. frost blast first applies the area damage, the debuff, then the base damage. scepter while channeling sinister gaze, frost blast has an instant cast time and does not require facing the target to cast. frost shield link link wf abilitytarget unit affectsenemies / allies(ice spire) applies a magical frost shield around the target, reducing damage from

mortal years, the frost magic that ethreain weaves around himself has only grown colder with time. can be cast on any non-invulnerable ally unit. this includes others wards-type units (e.g phoenix sun), couriers and buildings. heals ice spire for 1 hero hit (or 2 of the unit's health) per pulse. double-tapping automatically targets self. applies generic incoming damage reduction on the affected target. stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation. affects only hero-based attack damage, including instant attack sources, regardless of damage type, the affected target recieves. treats attack damage from clones, illusions and the spirit bear as heroes, from buildings and other creep-heroes as creeps. does not reduce the following damage sources: spell damage. damage flagged as hp removal. all cleave sources. pulses in 1-second intervals, starting 0.1 seconds after cast, resulting in 5/6/7/8 ( 9/10/11/12) pulses. all pulses together deal up to 90/192/322/480 ( 162/320/506/720) damage per enemy (before reductions). can heal up to 5/6/7/8 ( 9/10/11/12) of the ice spire's health for the entire duration. the pulses first apply their damage, then the movement speed slow debuff. frost shield does not hit invisible units or units in the fog of war. successive casts on the same target do not stack but refresh the duration, and reset the pulse interval. both leveling up frost shield and the health regeneration talent do not update the current active instance. scepter while channeling sinister gaze, frost shield has an instant cast time, does not require facing the target to cast and can be cast on untargetable allies. talent the health regeneration talent fully works for ward-type units and buildings as well, except for ice spires. can regenerate up to 250/300/350/400 ( 450/500/550/600) health over its full duration. however, it does not update the currently active instance of frost shield. the health regeneration bonus applied fully heals ward-type units that require a fixed amount of hero attacks to destroy. other aspects of the ability fully affects the phoenix sun, but the health regeneration bonus is not applied despite visually regenerating health. sinister gaze link er abilitytarget unit ( target area) / channeled affectsenemies ( self) damagephysical hypnotizes an enemy unit, causing it to move towards a

non-channeled abilities and items during sinister gaze without interrupting it. mind the cold... applies a hypnotizing fear and provides true sight over the target, forcing it to face and move towards the lich, and preventing it from acting. does not provide any form of other visions over the target(s). certain status effects on the affected target that might cancel other channeling abilities do not cancel sinister gaze. this includes the following status effects: the target turning invisible, invulnerable or hidden. the target being affected by the fog of war. the target being dispelled in any way. in short, sinister gaze can only be canceled if lich's channeling is interrupted. applies the following effects on the affected target(s) while sinister gaze is channeling: grants the affected target unobstructed movement and does not destroy trees while moving. unlocks the target's minimum and maximum movement speed limits, then sets the target's movement speed to 32%/38%/44%/50% of the distance between lich and the target. the set movement speed does not adapt even if target is moved or teleported. when cast at max cast range, this results in a speed of 174.55 ( 128). drains 12% of target's current mana in 0.1-second intervals, resulting in 11/14/17/20 ( 15/18/21/24) instances. can drain up to 12.44%/15.55%/18.55%/21.45% ( 13.99%/16.55%/19.03%/21.43%) of the target(s)' current mana. the mana gained is based on how much the target actually lose on each interval, enemy targets with higher current mana will restore more mana than using the ability on a target with lesser current mana. if they have no mana left, no mana is gained either. however, if lich is at full mana, the target still continues to lose mana. deals 25 damage to creeps based on the same intervals, starting immediately upon cast, resulting in 22/28/34/40 ( 30/36/42/48) instances. can deal up to 550/700/850/1000 ( 750/900/1050/1200) damage to creeps (before reductions). treats illusions, creep-heroes and ancient creeps as heroes. destroys trees within a 200 radius around the target at the end of the channeling. all aspects of sinister gaze are not affected by status resistance sources. scepter sinister gaze now turns into an area-targeted ability, so that it cannot directly target units anymore. fully affects untargetable, invisible units and units under fog of war. the ability upgrade now allows lich to cast his other abilities (e.g. frost blast, frost shield, ice spire and chain frost) while channeling sinister gaze without interrupting it, as long as the target is within cast range. this means during sinister gaze, all of lich's abilities have an instant cast time and do not require facing the target to cast. does not apply to item abilities. spell steal / morph notes sinister gaze's ability upgrade is only limited to lich's basic abilities. ice spire link link link de abilitytarget point / passive affectsenemies creates an ice spire at the

the current level of frost blast centered on the ice spire's location upon its destruction. the frost blast applied is independent of the ability and does not cost any mana. frost blast notes fully apply. if it is not learned, it is not applied. frost shield applies all its ability effects and heals the ice spire for 2 health. always heals for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much damage the targets actually take. treats attacks from clones as heroes, and attacks from creep-heroes and illusions as creeps. chain frost can bounce on, and be directly targeted on ice spires. it may only bounce to the spire if no other valid targets are within its bounce distance. the bounces still fully count toward the bounce limit. can only bounce on ally ice spires, enemy spires are ignored. if multiple spires are within range, it chooses one at random. can bounce back and forth between multiple spires if no enemies are within range. ice spire gains its spell immunity through a buff, so it is possible for enemies to check the buff and ping the remaining duration of the ward. scepter while channeling sinister gaze, ice spire has an instant cast time and does not require facing the

the ultimate in frost magic, ethreain's orb of frozen death strikes fear into those who dare stand against him. chain frost initially travels at a speed of 1050, and continues traveling at a speed of 850 after bouncing off the primary target. the projectile bounces with a 0.2-second delay. the projectile stops providing vision and stops playing a sound upon hitting non-hero units when bouncing more than 60 times. can bounce on the same unit multiple times, but only when another target was hit between the bounces. can bounce on invulnerable units only when the projectile is currently airborne. for undying zombies and couriers, chain frost can be cast on them, but not bounce on them. does not bounce on hidden and invisible units, and already invulnerable units. however, it can bounce on untargetable units from shadows and shadow realm. chain frost fully affects roshan only when the first instance is cast on him. otherwise, the projectile can bounce on, but neither damages nor applies its debuff. chain frost first applies the debuff, then the damage. leveling up the ability immediately updates all currently active chain frost projectiles. for how much damage (before reductions) chain frost deals up to the 10th stack, please refer to the chart below. can potentially deal up to 3575/5500/7425 damage total if all bounces hit. the projectile has an 800 range flying vision. the vision is provided after the 0.2-second bounce delay. scepter while channeling sinister gaze, chain frost has an instant cast time and does not require facing the target to cast. talent the chain frost on death talent cast chain frost based on its current level passively and instantly from lich's death location whenever he dies, prioritizing the nearest unit. the search range can be increased by cast range bonuses. the passive cast on death does not trigger the ability cooldown and work while on cooldown, and does not cost mana. it is also displayed on the hud as a buff. they do not proc on-cast effects either. does not trigger with reincarnation sources.

 Cripple



Casting Summon Wolves replaces currently active wolves from a previous cast, even when they are invulnerable or hidden.
However, it does not replace wolves from a previous cast that are dominated by enemies.
Grants  Lycan Wolves the following abilities at the following Summon Wolves levels:
LEVEL 3  Invisibility
LEVEL 4  Cripple
Both leveling up the ability and the health increasing  talent do not update the current summoned wolves' stats.
It also neither updates the current summoned wolves' ability values nor grants them new abilities.
TALENT However, the attack damage increasing  talent does immediately update all of Lycan's currently living wolves.
Lycan Wolves always spawn in the same formation, 200 range in front of Lycan, and with a 120 range between the wolves.
Lycan is always at the center of the line of the first two spawned wolves.
The wolves face the same angle as Lycan.
Has a cast backswing of 0.6 during  Wolf Form.
SHARD 1  Lane Wolf is now spawned together with each creep wave in one random lane.
The lane for the spawned wolf is selected at complete random each time.
If Summon Wolves is not learned, the Lane Wolf does not spawn.
The Lane Wolf has the lowest target priority than any other unit, so they are targeted by auto-attacks last.
The Lane Wolf spawns even while Lycan is dead.
SHARD Aside from the Lane Wolf being uncontrollable, it interacts with Lycan's abilities just like a regular  Lycan Wolf would:
Lycan is considered its owner, the last hits made by the Lane Wolf grant bounty and experience to Lycan.
 Howl upon cast is applied around it as well.
 Feral Impulse notes fully apply.
Grants  Shapeshift's critical strike proc chance, but not the haste speed.
The Lane Wolf has  Cripple and it can proc on buildings.
Does not have Invisibility.
SPELL STEAL After losing ability, re-acquiring and recasting the ability create new  Lycan Wolves without replacing the wolves from the previous cast. Howl Link▶️WW



AbilityNo Target
AffectsEnemies (Wolves)


Strikes fear into enemies, reducing armor and attack damage of all enemies within 2000 range of Lycan and his wolves. Non-hero controlled units flee for a short time. At night Howl's armor and attack damage reductions are Global.

modifier_lycan_howlAnyBlood-curdling wolf cries signal to opponents that Banehallow is among them.


Lycan and his wolves (both  Lycan Wolf and   Lane Wolf) apply the ability effects around them simultaneously, there is no delay.
Does not apply the ability effects when they are invulnerable or hidden.
The Howl debuff has the following mechanics:
It does not stack. Enemies can only be affected by the debuff once, despite being within range of multiple sources.
The debuff can only be applied by the caster, including the caster's Lycan Wolves and Lane Wolves. Other player-controlled units do not apply the debuff around them.
Applies a flat attack damage reduction based on the affected units' main attack damage. Does not further reduce bonus attack damage.
TALENT Howl now reduces the target's main and bonus attack damage.
Does not reduce conditional attack damage bonuses (e.g.  Pierce or  Shadow Walk).
Stacks additively with other total attack damage reduction sources.
Applies fear only to the following enemy player-controlled non-hero units:
 Boar,   Eidolon,   Forged Spirit,   Hawk,   Lycan Lane Wolf,   Lycan Wolf,   Minor Imp,   Necronomicon Archer,   Necronomicon Warrior,   Spiderite,   Spiderling,   Treant,   Wraith King Skeleton
Treat creep-heroes as heroes.
Successive casts update the ability values and refresh its duration.
Howl's sound effects are Global for allies. Feral Impulse  EI

AbilityTarget Unit
AffectsAllied Heroes


Lycan bites an ally, granting them Shapeshift properties. Lycan and the bitten target gain 30% Lifesteal and share the healing effect of Lifesteal with each other as long as they are within 1200 range of each other.

Ability Draft Notes:
Requires drafting  Shapeshift to be unlocked.
Does this bite look infected?


Requires  Aghanim's Scepter to be unlocked.
The lifesteal component is granted immediately upon cast.
Grants regular lifesteal and shared lifesteal to both the caster and the target.
This means both Lycan and the targeted ally always are healed within 1200 no matter who attacks.
However, the lifesteal aura only affects the targeted ally, other player-controlled units owned by the ally do not gain these bonuses.
Lifesteal amplification affects shared lifesteal as well, but only if the amplification source is the healed unit.
The regular lifesteal works regardless of distance and stacks additively with other lifesteal sources.
The Wolf Form properties are granted upon finishing the transformation. It relies on  Shapeshift to work since it directly uses its values. This affects the following things:
If Shapeshift is not learned, Wolf Bite will be at level 1. Upon cast, the targeted ally is prevented from acting for 1.1 seconds and it cannot be interrupted.
Wolf Bite automatically levels up with Shapeshift and cannot be leveled up separately.
Applies all effects of Shapeshift based on its current level on the ally, including the transformation time, the base  nighttime vision bonus, the critical strike proc chance and the haste speed.
Other Shapeshift notes fully apply.
Treat clones and creep-heroes as heroes.
Has a cast backswing of 0.6 during  Wolf Form. Shapeshift Link▶️RF

Forever a slave to his lycanthropy, Banehallow has come to accept his curse, and embrace his own savagery.


During the transformation, Lycan is prevented from acting and it cannot be interrupted.
Increases Lycan's base  night vision to a total of 1800.
Turns the caster into a  melee unit with 150 attack range for its duration.
This causes items that use different values for melee and ranged heroes (e.g.  Manta Style) to treat the caster as a melee hero.
Attack range sources are fully overridden, including passive item bonuses,  talents, etc.
The movement speed bonus and critical strike proc chance are provided by a Global aura which affects all player-controlled units owned by Lycan.
The aura's effects linger for 0.1 seconds.
Does not affect invulnerable units and wards.
Hastes affected units, meaning they cannot be slowed below 550 movement speed.
The critical strike increases the attack damage of Lycan and all his units by an average of 24%/36%/48%.
The proc chances of multiple crit sources stack.
If two sources of critical strike proc at the same time, the higher multiplier has priority.
The critical strike uses pseudo-random distribution.
Lycan gets his current and max health increased by the given value. This counts as setting health.
Upon losing the buff, his current health stays the same and only the max health bonus gets reverted.
Shapeshift is fully canceled on death. Invisibility 



AbilityPassive

Permanently invisible when not attacking.

Fade Delay: 2Modifiers [?]modifier_lycan_summon_wolves_invisibilityDeath
modifier_invisibleDeath



Requires LEVEL 3+  Summon Wolves to be unlocked.
Lycan Wolf will keep turning invisible for its summoned duration.
During the fade delay, Lycan Wolf can still perform attacks.
Invisibility sources with fade delays use the same modifier and do not stack with other invisibility sources of the same type — the longer duration overrides the shorter one.
While invisible, Lycan Wolf can still turn without breaking invisible.
Attacking breaks the invisibility and resets the fade delay. Missed attacks or attacking items do break it.
Does not grant phased movement. Cripple  Link▶️

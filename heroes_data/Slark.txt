After a short delay, Slark sacrifices some of his life blood, purging most negative debuffs and dealing damage to enemy units around him and to himself. Slark only takes 0.3 of the damage.

Slark leaps forward, grabbing the first hero he connects with and applying Essence Shift Stacks. That unit is leashed, and can only move a limited distance away from Slark's landing position.

Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
Provides charges and increases range.

Debuff Immunity Notes:Does not leash or slow debuff immune units. Pounce has no max stretch distance, so the unit can move any distance without breaking the leash. If the unit loses the debuff immunity, they can still move freely, but are leashed again, unable to use mobility spells.Root Notes:Getting rooted while already leaping does not cancel the leap.Modifiers [?]modifier_slark_pounceDeath

modifier_slark_pounce_leashDeathAbility Draft Notes:
 Essence Shift must be drafted as well for it to get applied.
Time in the Dark Reef made Slark a dangerous assassin; aggressive and fearless.


Leaps at a speed of 933.33 ( 1333.33) for up to 0.75 seconds.
Does not disjoint projectiles upon cast.
Pounce has the following leap mechanics:
Always leaps toward the direction Slark is facing. Does not lock Slark's facing angle during the leap.
Always leaps the full distance, unless an enemy hero gets within 120 radius of Slark during the leap.
Moves Slark upwards over other units and over impassable terrain.
Slark can turn and cast abilities and items during Pounce, but cannot attack.
With the maximum distance and latch radius, Pounce can latch on enemy heroes up to 820 ( 1120) range away.
Can only latch on heroes and clones. Does not latch on illusions and creep-heroes.
Can latch on invisible units, but not on invulnerable or hidden units.
When latching on a unit, Slark is automatically ordered to attack the target.
Pounce first applies the leash debuff, then apply 0/1/2/3  Essence Shift stacks based on its current level.
Essence Shift notes fully apply. If it is not learned, no stacks are applied.
Stops the enemy by slowing their movement speed.
The slow gets exponentially stronger towards the edges of the 120 leash radius.
This effectively causes the target to come to a halt if the leash is stretched too much.
The slow is only present when facing away from the center. The target is not slowed when facing toward the center.
Since the slow is fluctuating a lot, it is not displayed in the HUD.
The leashed enemy hero is prevented from casting certain mobility abilities.
If cast before getting leashed, the following abilities are not able to break the leash:  Skewer,  Leap,  Pounce,  Tree Dance,  Primal Spring,  Toggle Movement, and an enemy-targeted  Hurricane Pike.
Every other position changing effect, can break the leash when stretching it beyond the maximum radius.
 Force Staff,  Hurricane Pike,  Force Boots, and  Psychic Headband do not dispel the Pounce debuff on the target, regardless of the maximum radius.
When the leash expires while a position-changing effect (e.g. knockback) is ongoing, it instantly cancels the position-changing effect.
This goes for the following abilities:  Flamebreak,  Primal Roar,  Power Cogs,  Hookshot,  Vacuum,  Gust,  Boulder Smash,  Rolling Boulder,  Geomagnetic Grip,  Deafening Blast,  Tether,  Blinding Light,  Adaptive Strike (Strength),  Blast Off!,  Charge of Darkness,  Greater Bash,  Timber Chain,  Walrus PUNCH!,  Force Staff and  Hurricane Pike.
Destroys trees within 100 radius around Slark upon landing.
Pounce cannot be cast during Pounce. During the leap, Pounce is on a non-refreshable cooldown which is bound to the leap buff.
Deals 0 damage to the affected unit.
Fully procs on damage effects, such as  Corrosive Skin, except for abilities which have a minimum damage threshold (e.g.  Gravekeeper's Cloak).
 Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
Always has a base charge replenish time of 12 regardless of Pounce's current level. Essence Shift   EN

Essence Shift cannot reduce any attribute below 0. However, Slark continues to gain agility, even when the attacked hero has no more attributes left to steal.
This applies to the temporary steal, as well as the permanent steal.
Each stack places a new buff on Slark and a new debuff on the affected enemy. This means their durations are independent from each other.
The number of stacks and the duration of the last stack can be seen on the status buff icon.
Upon death, the dying hero's attributes restore back to their normal values, while Slark keeps the bonus agility values for the remaining duration.
When Slark dies, he loses all temporarily stolen attributes, but the affected enemies do not get theirs back, and vice versa.
Can temporarily steal attributes from allies and clones, but not from illusions.
Permanently stolen  agility is removed from the enemy's bonus agility and added to Slark's bonus agility.
Grants a stack in the following conditions as long as the Essence Shift debuff has not expired:
The enemy hero has to die within the 300 steal radius while having the Essence Shift debuff, including denied enemy heroes.
To permanently steal agility outside the steal radius, Slark has to be credited for the kill. Other player-controlled units do not count.
Can steal independently from each  Meepo Clones as long as it fulfill the conditions above.
Can steal agility even when Slark is dead as the kill happens.
Does not permanently grant a stack in the following conditions:
When killing an ally hero with the debuff.
If the enemy hero has Reincarnation.

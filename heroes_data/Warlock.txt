so all targets are bonded and damaged at the same time. when cast multiple times, it searches and prioritizes enemies that were not debuffed by the previous cast, and then it searches for the next closest units. the debuff can still stack on the same units if no other previously bonded units are nearby. can bond units inside the fog of war, but cannot bond invisible units. the bond can only bounce to untargetable units from shadow realm and shadows. does not affect roshan at all. successive casts of fatal bonds fully stack and work independently from each other. damage shared is the same type as the source damage. shares all 3 damage types, but not from hp removal effects (e.g. sunder). therefore, the shared damage interacts with every on-damage effects (i.e. disabling blink dagger). shared physical damage and magical damage is still affected by damage block and magic resistance respectively, and interacts with their respective damage barrier types. it is also fully affected by outgoing damage manipulation sourced to warlock. instant kill effects in the form of hp removal (e.g. sacred arrow on creeps) share an instance of 0 damage to all affected targets. fully procs on-damage effects, except those which have a minimum damage threshold (e.g. gravekeeper's cloak). fatal bonds' damage has the no-reflection flag, preventing its damage from interacting with other sources of damage with the same flag. spreads the full damage value before the affected enemy targets actually take the damage. this means that the damage spreads before all manipulations, so that it may only be affected by incoming damage manipulation the affected targets have. this also means it shares damage instances that exceeded the targets' current health and killed them. the shared damage is always sourced to warlock. therefore, if a unit dies to the damage done by fatal bonds, warlock gets credited for the kill. the distance between the bonded units does not matter. once bonded, they always spread and/or receive the spread damage. non-player-controlled units are not aggro'd by the damage. neutral creeps do not react to the damage. increases the total damage output of every damage by 60%/80%/100%/120% ( 80%/100%/120%/140%) when the maximum amount of units is bonded. only dying enemy units affected by fatal bonds spawn minor imps, regardless how the kill was made. this includes the following: reincarnation sources. being killed by neutral creeps. does not spawn imps from enemies dying to the following sources: being denied or denying oneself. forced kill sources. minor imps are uncontrollable. however, they can be boosted by allied abilities or auras. they automatically choose the nearest valid attack target within , prioritizing heroes affected by fatal bonds. minor imps continue chasing their target even when the target turns invisible and untargetable. 0.2 seconds after reaching its target, eldritch explosion based on its current level is passively applied. minor imps only attack the nearest building and do not explode, if there are no other valid targets. despite being uncontrollable, they can be dominated. however, the minor imp continues its attempt to move to the last known location of its set target. each minor imp spawned has its own duration. they use the same model as warlock golem and have a smaller model size. shard increases the minor imp's level by based on the time spwaned and does not upgrade. shadow word link link ww abilitytarget unit ( target area) affectsunits damagemagical warlock whispers an incantation, healing a friendly

Lifestealer's attacks deal damage and provide heal for a percentage of his target's max health.

Enemy Max Health as Heal: 1.6%/2.2%/2.8%/3.4% ( 2.8%/3.4%/4%/4.6%)Enemy Max Health as Damage: 1%/1.3%/1.6%/1.9% ( 2.2%/2.5%/2.8%/3.1%)Modifiers [?]modifier_life_stealer_feastUndispellable
After escaping from his cell in Devarque, N'aix subsisted on flesh and bones of those unfortunate to cross his path.


Always heal for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much damage the target actually receives (before reductions).
Therefore, the healing value is not affected by the following:
Damage-negating sources (e.g.  Refraction).
Damage block sources.
 Incoming damage manipulation on the affected target.
Does not heal from attacking ward-type units,  Roshan, buildings and ally units.
The max health as bonus damage is considered as a conditional attack damage bonus.
Although the attack damage bonus values are not displayed in the HUD, it is still considered and directly added to Lifestealer's attack damage.
The attack damage bonus values are considered by lifesteal, critical strike, and cleave, and it can be reduced only by flat reductions (e.g. damage block).
Since it is considered bonus attack damage, it is not affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions.
Feast first self-heals, then apply its attack damage.
The percentage-based heal per hit is affected by lifesteal manipulation but not heal manipulation. Ghoul Frenzy   EG

DamagePhysical

Lifestealer rends an enemy unit, slowing the victim's movement speed and allowing all allies to regain health for a percentage of the damage they deal to that unit. All damage dealt will steal life, including damage from spells. The victim recovers movement speed over the duration. Deals 2% of the target's max health per attack on the target from real heroes. After receiving 500 damage, the Open Wounds fester and spread to a non-infected random enemy within 700 radius.

modifier_life_stealer_open_woundsAnyAbility Draft Notes:
Requires drafting  Infest to be unlocked.
Fresh wounds and the scent of blood often draw out the scavengers to finish the job.


Requires  Aghanim's Shard to be unlocked.
Open Wounds spreads to a random unit within 700 radius that does not have the debuff already, prioritizing heroes, once the affected target collectively takes 500 damage (after all reductions).
Treat creep-heroes as creeps.
Successive casts on the same target neither stack nor allow the debuff to spread, but refresh its movement speed slow values and duration.
Each Open Wounds debuff can only spread once. It cannot spread to the same unit again per cast.
The debuff also does not spread while reaching the damage threshold with no valid targets within its search radius.
The spreading is not limited to the unit Open Wounds was cast on, the Open Wounds debuffs created via spreading can spread as well.
The debuff can spread onto invisible units and units in the Fog of War.
Does not spread to invulnerable units.
Neutral creeps are not aggro'd when the debuff is spread onto them.
The heal values are considered as lifesteal, and can still be subjected to lifesteal manipulation.
Stacks additively with other lifesteal sources.
Casting instant kill sources (e.g.  Transmute) on a unit affected by Open Wounds heals the caster based on the affected target's current health.
Spell damage from heals the caster as lifesteal.
The spread damage threshold condition still applies for the aforementioned damage sources.
Does not heal from and count the following damage sources to its damage threshold:
Damage flagged as HP Removal and/or self-damage, except for  Corrosive Skin and  Fatal Bonds.
Damage damage dealt by buildings, wards, neutral creeps, or the affected target's allies.
Applies 7 instances 50%/50%/40%/30%/20%/10%/10% decreasing movement speed slow, decreasing one step per second for its duration.
The max health as bonus damage is only applied to attacks done by heroes.
Treats attack from clones and illusions as heroes, attacks from creep-heroes as creeps.
The damage is considered as a conditional attack damage bonus.
Although the attack damage bonus values are not displayed in the HUD, it is still considered and directly added to the hero's attack damage.
The attack damage bonus values are considered by lifesteal, critical strike, and cleave, and it can be reduced only by flat reductions (e.g. damage block).
Since it is considered bonus attack damage, it is not affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions.
The conditional attack damage bonus does not affect  Roshan.
Open Wounds first apply its damage (after reductions), then heal based on the damage dealt. Infest  Link▶️Link▶️RT

Damage Instant Attack

Lifestealer infests the body of a target unit, becoming undetectable, and healing for a portion of his max hitpoints every second while inside. He can then explode from the host body, dealing damage to nearby enemies. If the infested unit is an enemy creep or a neutral creep, he can take control of the unit's ability to move and attack. Does not work on enemy heroes.

modifier_life_stealer_infest_enemy_heroDeathWith this infestation, N'aix consumes the life blood of the host, restoring him back to full unholy power.

     Visual indicator above the  Infested target.  
Applies a basic dispel and disjoints projectiles upon cast.
Unlike a regular basic dispel, Infest also dispels various buffs (e.g.  Double Damage Rune or  Recall) on Lifestealer.
During Infest, all of Lifestealer's abilities are hidden, while Infest is replaced by the  Consume sub-ability.
Lifestealer is now invulnerable, hidden, spell immune, and is periodically moved to the host's current position. This affects the following things:
Upon Infest ending in any way, Lifestealer reappears at the host's current location.
Every aura Lifestealer has (e.g.  Radiance) is bestowed around the host.
Ability effects that interact with heroes' presence (e.g.  Smoke of Deceit,  Marksmanship) react on the host's presence.
 Relocate forces Lifestealer out of the Infested unit, dealing its area damage.
Can fully regenerate Lifestealer's health within 33.33/25/20 ( 16.67/12.5/10) seconds.
The following effects are applied to the Infested unit:
Grants current and max health bonuses by the given value. This counts as setting health.
Does not increase the health of ancient creeps.
Cannot Infest spell immune units.
If the affected target is a hero, including illusions and creep-heroes, it grants percentage-based movement speed bonus to the affected target.
If the affected target is a creep, Lifestealer automatically takes control of it, turning it into his unit.
Infest also replenishes its mana and set its base movement speed to expr LifestealerCurrentMS × 1.15/1.2/1.25 ( 1.3/1.35/1.4).
The controlled creep also retains its health bar colors for camouflaging purposes.
It also can be dominated (e.g.  Holy Persuasion) normally, with its source ability notes fully apply. Lifestealer can only cast  Consume in this case.
For  Minor Imps, despite being uncontrollable, the Minor Imp continues its attempt to move to the last known location of its set target.
The affected unit also receives a hidden modifier, which creates the visual effect above it, visible to allies only.
Infest also has the following cast restrictions on units:
LEVEL 1+ Can be cast on, but cannot control ally heroes and ally creep-heroes.
LEVEL 2+ Can be cast on and control ancient creeps.
Cannot be cast on  Roshan,  Couriers,  Undying Zombies, wards, buildings, enemy heroes and enemy creep-heroes.
 Reinforced units receive  10% less damage (before reductions) from the infested creep.
The ability's cooldown starts upon leaving the infested unit, not upon cast.
SCEPTER Infest can now be cast on enemy heroes and creep-heroes.
Does not increase the health or movement speed of such targets, but disarms them.
Although having a limited duration on these targets, Lifestealer still may use  Consume to leave the host earlier.
Causes Lifestealer to perform instant attacks on the Infested enemy target in 1.25-second intervals, starting immediately upon cast, resulting in up to 5 attacks.
These instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. They do not have True Strike, but completely ignore disarms.
SPELL STEAL Although the same target can be affected by multiple sources of Infest, the health increase effect does not stack. If the target is a creep, only the first Infest cast can control the unit and use the  Consume sub-ability.

Replaces  Infest until the sub-ability is used, or until Lifestealer gets out of the host in any way.
If the infested target is a creep, and Lifestealer takes control over it, it also appears in the infested unit's HUD, in the next available ability slot.
Consume only instant kill creeps upon cast.
Applies the radius damage instantly even when the Infested unit dies before Lifestealer consumes it.
SPELL STEAL If there are multiple sources of Infest on the same target, the first Consume cast causes both sources to be ejected from the affected target and damages the first caster who cast Consume.

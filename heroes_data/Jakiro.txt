modifier_jakiro_dual_breath_slowany modifier_jakiro_dual_breath_burnanypyrexae dragons have tremendously dangerous breath for each branch of the species; combining them is unimaginable. targeting a unit causes the breaths to be released toward the unit's position. both the icy and fiery wave travel at a speed of 1050, taking 0.71 ( 1.43) seconds to travel the full distance. with the travel distance and end radius, dual breath can hit units up to 1025 ( 1775) range away. the complete area of both breaths is shaped like a cone. the icy breath first deals 0 damage to affected units, then applies its movement speed and attack speed slow. successive casts reapplies the icy breath and update the slow values based on its current values. the fiery breath is released 0.2 seconds after the icy breath is released. this means it is possible for enemies to be hit by only one of the breaths, by getting in or out of range of the second breath. jakiro cannot move until both waves are released but can use items and abilities, and turn a little bit between the first and the second breath. the first damage instance of the fiery breath deals 0 damage. deals 10/20/30/40 ( 20/40/60/80) damage in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately after the fire debuff is placed, the second interval is 0.1 seconds, the rest are 0.5 seconds, resulting in 11 instances. can deal up to 100/200/300/400 ( 200/400/600/800) damage (before reductions) to a single unit. successive casts neither stack nor update the damage values of the current instance but refreshes its duration. it also continues ticking with the same intervals as the first cast. the 0-damage instance from both the icy and the fiery breath fully proc on-damage effects, such as corrosive skin, except those which have a minimum damage threshold (e.g. gravekeeper's cloak). ice path link wt abilitytarget point affectsenemies damagemagical creates a path of ice that stuns and damages enemies that touch it. cast animation: 0.65+0.8cast

visual effects, ice path's effects are instantly applied after the 0.5-second delay. the ice path starts 12 range in front of jakiro and has a length of 1200. with the starting distance, path length, and path radius, ice patch can hit units up to 1362 range away. it can also hit units 138 range behind jakiro, due to its radius and starting position. enemy units that come within 150 radius of the path while it is up get stunned and damaged by it. the stun duration is independent of the path duration. however, the stun duration expires as soon as the path disappears. the path grants 150 range flying vision along the path based on the path duration. enemies may only be stunned once per cast, so if dispelled, they cannot get stunned by it again. ice path first applies the debuff, then the damage. talent the duration increasing talent increases the stun duration by 0.5 seconds instead. liquid fire link link eq abilityactive attack modifier affectsenemies damagemagical jakiro burns his

modifier_jakiro_dual_breath_burnAnyPyrexae dragons have tremendously dangerous breath for each branch of the species; combining them is unimaginable.


Targeting a unit causes the breaths to be released toward the unit's position.
Both the icy and fiery wave travel at a speed of 1050, taking 0.71 ( 1.43) seconds to travel the full distance.
With the travel distance and end radius, Dual Breath can hit units up to 1025 ( 1775) range away.
The complete area of both breaths is shaped like a cone.
The icy breath first deals 0 damage to affected units, then applies its movement speed and attack speed slow.
Successive casts reapplies the icy breath and update the slow values based on its current values.
The fiery breath is released 0.2 seconds after the icy breath is released.
This means it is possible for enemies to be hit by only one of the breaths, by getting in or out of range of the second breath.
Jakiro cannot move until both waves are released but can use items and abilities, and turn a little bit between the first and the second breath.
The first damage instance of the fiery breath deals 0 damage.
Deals 10/20/30/40 ( 20/40/60/80) damage in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately after the fire debuff is placed, the second interval is 0.1 seconds, the rest are 0.5 seconds, resulting in 11 instances.
Can deal up to 100/200/300/400 ( 200/400/600/800) damage (before reductions) to a single unit.
Successive casts neither stack nor update the damage values of the current instance but refreshes its duration. It also continues ticking with the same intervals as the first cast.
The 0-damage instance from both the icy and the fiery breath fully proc on-damage effects, such as  Corrosive Skin, except those which have a minimum damage threshold (e.g.  Gravekeeper's Cloak). Ice Path Link▶️WT

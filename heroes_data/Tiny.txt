when called by the stone giant. avalanche's projectile travels at a speed of 1200. deals 16/32/48/64 ( 32/48/64/80) damage in 0.3-second intervals, starting once the projectile reaches the targeted point, resulting in 5 instances. this results in a total duration of 1.2 seconds, counting after projectile arrival. the in-game tooltip includes the stun duration as well, showing a total duration of 1.5 seconds. the unit affected by toss takes 2 times the damage from avalanche regardless of its source. can deal up to 32/64/96/128 ( 64/96/128/160) per instance. when perfectly combined with toss, it can deal up to 160/320/480/640 ( 320/480/640/800) damage (before reductions). on each instance, avalanche first applies the damage, then the debuff. toss link link wt abilitytarget unit ( target

[?]modifier_tiny_tossundispellable tiny's gargantuan stature allows him to catapult even the sturdiest of warriors. the tossed unit travels at a speed based on the distance between it and the target, capped at 2308. the speed does not instantly adapt if the distance changes, but rather accelerates or decelerates at a slow rate. can toss any unit, except for couriers, ancient creeps, buildings, and wards. invisible enemy units cannot be tossed, but they can still take damage from a unit being tossed onto or near them. units in the fog of war can be tossed if they are within the 300 grab radius of tiny, but cannot be selected as a target. cannot target buildings, but they take 27/53/80/107 damage if within the damage radius. can directly target and toss the target towards runes, but cannot toss runes. cannot toss allies who have disabled help from tiny if they are the only valid target. toss deals a total of damage (before reductions) at the following grow levels to units and buildings respectively: level 1 180/260/340/420 ( 59.99/86.66/113.32/139.99) level 2 280/360/440/520 ( 93.32/119.99/146.65/173.32) level 3 380/460/540/620 ( 126.65/153.32/179.98/206.65) the tossed unit can be avoided by blinking or moving rapidly, but cannot technically be disjointed. this means the tossed unit can fly up to 3000 range away when the target teleports far enough away. toss' modifier is hidden in the hud. it persists through the target's death, so it continues flying and still applies the area damage upon landing. the affected target is disabled and prevented from acting. while tossed upwards and other units may pass below the airborne unit. destroys trees within a 100 radius around the tossed unit upon landing. triggers empower spell against a targeted enemy if it is not the same unit that is being tossed. talent the toss requires no target talent turns toss into an area-targeted ability, so that it can target the ground, as well as units. when ground-targeted, its tosses the unit towards the targeted point. only runes can no longer be directly targeted when this talent is learned. acquiring the toss charges talent instantly grants 1 extra charge. soulbind the ability is cast a second time when and/or before the primary target lands. does nothing if there are no valid toss targets. tree grab link link ec abilitytarget unit affectsenemies (trees) damagephysical grabs a tree to whack enemies on the head for a limited number of attacks. grants bonus attack range. attacks deal more damage and fully splash on units along the way. the tree can be thrown, to deal your attack to a unit at a distance. cast animation: 0.2+1.24cast range: 165area damage length: 400area damage radius: 200number of attacks: 5 ( infinite)set base attack range: 350unit

volley. their cooldowns are separate. cannot swap to tree volley while tree throw is active. sticks and stones break all the bones, with structures sure to follow. tree grab's damage area visualized. the tree grab buff lasts until the charges are used up, the tree throw sub-ability is used, or until death. the number of remaining attacks is visible on the buff icon. the buff is visible to everyone. shard remaining charges on the hud are not reduced until tiny loses the tree. grabbing a new tree grants a new permanent status buff. upon cast, the mana is expended, but it does not go on cooldown. losing the grabbed tree in any way starts the ability's cooldown. turns the caster into a melee unit with 350 attack range until the tree is lost. this causes items that use different values for melee and ranged heroes (e.g. manta style) to now treat the caster as a melee hero. attack range bonuses are not overridden and still work normally. grants flat bonus attack damage. the bonus damage is applied when denying allied units. tree grab is a unique attack-based area damage that has the following properties: the area has the following flags: no-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing its damage from utilizing spell lifesteal. no-spell-amplification flag, preventing its damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification. the damage is affected by damage block. it fully stacks with other sources of cleaves, with multiple sources and working independently. applies its area damage upon attacking wards, or buildings, but not on allies and items. wards and buildings are unaffected by the area damage. despite the visual effect, the area damage is applied instantly in the whole area. the area is shaped like a rectangle with a semi-circle on top, and always starts in front of the attacking unit. the rectangle has a length of 400 and a width of 400. the semi-circle has a radius of 200. with the area damage length and width, the area damage can reach up to 600 range away from tiny. the building bonus attack damage is considered as a conditional attack damage bonus. although the attack damage bonus values are not displayed in the hud, it is still considered and directly added to tiny's attack damage. it can be reduced only by flat reductions (e.g. damage block). since it is considered bonus attack damage, it is not affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions. spell steal reduces attack range, ability effects persist if rubick loses the ability while still wielding a tree. tree throw link link ec abilitytarget point / target unit

[?]modifier_projectile_visiondeath modifier_tiny_toss_tree_bonusdeath modifier_tiny_tosstree_slowanyeven enemies can share in tiny's arbor ardor. replaces tree grab until tiny loses the tree. the tree travels at a speed of 900. when unit-targeted, the projectile homes in on the target, and hits the target upon fully reaching it. the tree thrown this way does not provide vision while homing to the target. when ground-targeted, the tree travels in a straight line up to 1200 range before it disappears. the tree thrown provides 200 radius flying vision around itself while traveling. the tree thrown has a 300 radius collision size. this means this way, the tree may hit the intended target before reaching the target point. with the travel distance and collision radius, the tree thrown can hit units up to 1500. the splash damage is centered around the first unit it hits, and not around where the tree was as it hit. when the tree hits a unit, no matter if unit-targeted or ground-targeted, it provides 200 radius flying vision at its location for 2 seconds. cannot be directly cast on couriers. however, the splash damage from ground-targeted throw does affect the courier. cause tiny to perform an instant attack on the targeted unit, or the first enemy it finds. these instant attacks deal 20 ( 120) bonus damage, they do not use tree grab's bonus damage values. it also applies splash damage around the target. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. they have true strike and ignore disarms. the splash effects are based on the target's position, damaging a trapezoid area in the opposite direction where the tree came from. if the caster is a ranged hero, the instant attacks do not use attack projectiles and are instant, but still count as ranged attacks. enemies around the primary target are hit by splash damage, instead of instant attacks. the splash damage has the no-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing its damage from utilising spell lifesteal. the splash damage has the no-spell-amplification flag, preventing its damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification. splash damage is affected by damage block. tree throw first applies the slow debuff, then the instant attack and splash damage. although the tree thrown is a projectile and it may look like a ranged attack, the attack still counts as a melee attack when coming from tiny. this means all abilities that use different values for melee and ranged heroes (e.g. skull basher) treat the caster as a melee hero. spell steal no longer can throw the wielded tree upon losing ability. soulbind only affects the primary target. tree volley link link link dr abilitytarget area / channeled affectsenemies (trees) damage instant attack tiny channels to

1000. checks for trees in the same intervals. if no tree is found within the area, the channeling ends prematurely. the trees within the tree grab radius are chosen randomly. causes tiny to perform instant attacks on all enemies within the damage radius. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. they have true strike and ignore disarms. cleave effects are based on the target's position, damaging a trapezoid area in the opposite direction where the tree came from. the tree thrown provides 200 radius flying vision around itself while traveling. when the

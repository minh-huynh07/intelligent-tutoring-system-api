sticky napalm link qc abilitytarget area affectsenemies damagephysical drenches an area in sticky oil, amplifying damage from batrider's attacks and abilities and slowing the movement speed and turn rate of enemies in the area. additional casts of sticky napalm continue to increase damage, up to 10 stacks. passive component require hits: 1cast animation: 0+0cast range: 600effect radius: 375 (

while he increases the flammability of his opponents. can be cast without having to face the targeted area. applies a debuff to enemy heroes within the radius. there is no travel time. leaving or entering the area afterward neither reapplies nor dispels the debuff. provides a 2-second 400 radius flying vision at the targeted point upon cast. the debuff slows and causes the damage. it also shows the number of current stacks the target has on the debuff icon, visible to everyone. affected units also have a number above them, showing the number of current stacks on the target. this number is only visible to batrider and his allies, however, they require vision over the target to see it. successive casts from the same source refresh the duration and ability values of the whole stack while adding one more instance. with max stacks, sticky napalm can deal up to 40/80/120/160 base application damage and slow movement speed up to 15%/30%/45%/60%. the turn rate slow does not increase per stack. sticky napalm first applies the application damage, the triggering damage per stack, and then the slow. can deal up to 40/80/120/160 ( 140/180/220/260) damage per triggering damage instance (before reductions). treats creep-heroes as creeps, and can deal up to 20/40/60/80 ( 70/90/110/130) damage. talent the damage increasing talent only increases the triggering damage but not the application damage. sticky napalm triggers on any damage instance caused by batrider, including base application damage of sticky napalm. does not trigger on the following damage sources: no-reflection flag hp removal sources (e.g. orb of venom-based items). does not trigger on the following items' damage, unless the source item is not in the inventory upon applying its damage: blood grenade, cloak of flames, radiance, spirit vessel and urn of shadows. batrider himself has to cause the damage. other player-controlled units do not trigger sticky napalm. does not affect wards or buildings. shard once the attack count reaches 1, the next successful attack done on an enemy hero or creep will passively apply a stack of sticky napalm based on its current level on the target. does not count attacks done against allies, wards, or buildings. sticky napalm passive procs are independent of the cooldown and do not require mana. spell steal / morph notes successive casts from different sources refresh the duration, it neither updates the ability value nor increases the triggering damage per stack. only the first unit's sticky napalm can increase the triggering damage per stack. flamebreak link link link wr abilitytarget area affectsenemies damagephysical hurls an explosive cocktail that explodes when it reaches the target location, knocking back, and dealing damage

of choice for batrider. flamebreak travels at a speed of 1400 until reaching the targeted point. the projectile provides 175 radius flying vision as it travels. this vision does not last. knocks units back at a speed of 714.29 ( 857.14), the knockback distance is always 250 ( 300), no matter how far the unit is from the center. also knocks affected enemies 100 units upwards, resulting in a small arc. units are not disabled during the knockback. they can still turn, attack, cast abilities, and use items. channeling abilities are not interrupted. can push units over impassable terrain. trees the units collide with are destroyed. applies a debuff on enemies upon projectile impact which deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after it is placed, resulting in 2/3/4/5 instances.

trail of flames from the air. the fire damages any enemies it touches, and destroys trees below batrider. cast animation: 0+0damage radius: 200damage per second: 30/60/90/120duration: 15 ( 19.5)

brush to find the fugitive. batrider just chooses to destroy the jungle along with his foes. interrupts batrider's channeling abilities upon cast. grants batrider unobstructed movement, allowing him to path over impassable terrain, units, buildings, and trees while active. destroy trees within 100 radius of batrider while active. does not grant flying movement. when the 15 ( 19.5)-second duration ends, the entire flame trail disappears at once as well. the fire trail from successive casts fully stacks and refreshes its duration. does not create a second fire trail. damage is dealt to every enemy unit which comes within 200 radius of the fire trail. deals 15/30/45/60 damage per interval, starting 0.1 seconds after cast, the first interval is 0.4 seconds, the rest are 0.5 seconds, resulting in 31 ( 40) damage instances. can deal up to 465/930/1395/1860 ( 600/1200/1800/2400) damage to a single unit (before reductions) when the affected unit stays in range for the full duration. when batrider dies during firefly, the already existing fire on the ground still stays for the remaining duration. the buffs remain visible in the hud, and are now only responsible for keeping the already existing fire up. this means when respawning before they expire, they do not make batrider fly again or make him leave fire behind again. does not affect roshan. spell steal / morph notes ability effects persist upon losing ability. flaming lasso link rf abilitytarget unit affectsenemies ( self) damagephysical lassoes an enemy and drags them in batrider's wake. dragged units cannot

modifier_batrider_flaming_lasso_selfdeathfew dare to ask to ride on the bat, as batrider gives them free of charge. flaming lasso fully disables the target for its duration. batrider is disarmed during flaming lasso. the disarm either last 2.25/2.75/3.25 seconds, or until the lasso is broken, whichever is shorter. shard batrider is no longer disarmed during flaming lasso. drags the affected target 300 distance behind batrider. the affected target is phased and can be dragged over impassable terrain. flaming lasso overrides every other position changing effect, making only teleport sources bring able to break the lasso. the following conditions can break the lasso: when either batrider or the lassoed target dies. when batrider teleports a distance greater than 425 range. when the target gets teleported (e.g. relocate) at any distance. it also breaks if the targets get affected by fear and hypnosis sources. when being affected by the following abilities: hitch a ride, pulverize, dismember and walrus kick. deals 25/40/50 damage (before reductions) in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately upon cast, with a total of 4/5/6 intervals. flaming lasso first applies the debuff, then the damage. cannot be cast on, but can drag invulnerable and hidden units. can be cast on couriers. can be cast on roshan, but he is neither disabled, dragged nor damaged. batrider is still disarmed. each flaming lasso's instance and duration are independent of each other. therefore, it is possible to have multiple units lassoed at the same time (e.g. with refresher orb). scepter the closest allied hero of the enemy target within 650 range is lassoed as well. treats creep-heroes and illusions as heroes. the secondary target is bound to the first, so it is dragged after it, at the same distance as the primary target is dragged behind batrider. this means the secondary target is dragged 600 distance behind batrider. the secondary lasso is independent of the primary. when the primary lasso is broken, its target can act freely while the secondary target remains dragged by it. does not treat couriers as secondary targets.

The debuff slows and causes the damage. It also shows the number of current stacks the target has on the debuff icon, visible to everyone.
Affected units also have a number above them, showing the number of current stacks on the target.
This number is only visible to Batrider and his allies, however, they require vision over the target to see it.
Successive casts from the same source refresh the duration and ability values of the whole stack while adding one more instance.
With max stacks, Sticky Napalm can deal up to 40/80/120/160 base application damage and slow movement speed up to 15%/30%/45%/60%.
The turn rate slow does not increase per stack.
Sticky Napalm first applies the application damage, the triggering damage per stack, and then the slow.

Does not affect wards or buildings.
SHARD Once the attack count reaches 1, the next successful attack done on an enemy hero or creep will passively apply a stack of Sticky Napalm based on its current level on the target.
Does not count attacks done against allies, wards, or buildings.
Sticky Napalm passive procs are independent of the cooldown and do not require mana.
SPELL STEAL / MORPH NOTES Successive casts from different sources refresh the duration, it neither updates the ability value nor increases the triggering damage per stack. Only the first unit's Sticky Napalm can increase the triggering damage per stack. Flamebreak Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️WR

When an enemy escapes into the Yama Raskav Jungle, most would cut through the brush to find the fugitive. Batrider just chooses to destroy the jungle along with his foes.


Interrupts Batrider's channeling abilities upon cast.
Grants Batrider unobstructed movement, allowing him to path over impassable terrain, units, buildings, and trees while active.
Destroy trees within 100 radius of Batrider while active.
Does not grant flying movement.
When the 15 ( 19.5)-second duration ends, the entire flame trail disappears at once as well.
The fire trail from successive casts fully stacks and refreshes its duration. Does not create a second fire trail.
Damage is dealt to every enemy unit which comes within 200 radius of the fire trail.
Deals 15/30/45/60 damage per interval, starting 0.1 seconds after cast, the first interval is 0.4 seconds, the rest are 0.5 seconds, resulting in 31 ( 40) damage instances.

When Batrider dies during Firefly, the already existing fire on the ground still stays for the remaining duration.
The buffs remain visible in the HUD, and are now only responsible for keeping the already existing fire up.
This means when respawning before they expire, they do not make Batrider fly again or make him leave fire behind again.
Does not affect  Roshan.

Flaming Lasso fully disables the target for its duration.
Batrider is disarmed during Flaming Lasso. The disarm either last 2.25/2.75/3.25 seconds, or until the lasso is broken, whichever is shorter.
SHARD Batrider is no longer disarmed during Flaming Lasso.
Drags the affected target 300 distance behind Batrider. The affected target is phased and can be dragged over impassable terrain.
Flaming Lasso overrides every other position changing effect, making only teleport sources bring able to break the lasso. The following conditions can break the lasso:
When either Batrider or the lassoed target dies.
When Batrider teleports a distance greater than 425 range.
When the target gets teleported (e.g.  Relocate) at any distance.
It also breaks if the targets get affected by Fear and Hypnosis sources.
When being affected by the following abilities:  Hitch A Ride,  Pulverize,  Dismember and  Walrus Kick.
Deals 25/40/50 damage (before reductions) in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately upon cast, with a total of 4/5/6 intervals.
Flaming Lasso first applies the debuff, then the damage.
Cannot be cast on, but can drag invulnerable and hidden units.
Can be cast on  Couriers.
Can be cast on  Roshan, but he is neither disabled, dragged nor damaged. Batrider is still disarmed.
Each Flaming Lasso's instance and duration are independent of each other.
Therefore, it is possible to have multiple units lassoed at the same time (e.g. with  Refresher Orb).
SCEPTER The closest allied hero of the enemy target within 650 range is lassoed as well.
Treats creep-heroes and illusions as heroes.
The secondary target is bound to the first, so it is dragged after it, at the same distance as the primary target is dragged behind Batrider.
This means the secondary target is dragged 600 distance behind Batrider.
The secondary lasso is independent of the primary. When the primary lasso is broken, its target can act freely while the secondary target remains dragged by it.
Does not treat  Couriers as secondary targets.

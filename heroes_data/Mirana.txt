The Goddess breaks the strata to empower her Princess in the time of need.


The meteors takes 0.57 seconds to hit their targets.
Does not hit invisible, invulnerable, hidden and untargetable units.
The initial wave does not hit units inside the Fog of War, but the secondary single meteor does.
The target for the secondary single meteor is set upon cast, it homes in on the target even after the target has moved out of the radius.
The second meteor starts falling exactly 0.8 seconds after cast, and also takes 0.57 seconds to hit its target.
Starstorm chooses a new target for the second meteor if the set target dies before or because of the first meteor's impact.
The secondary meteor deals 56.25/112.5/168.75/225 ( 243.75/300/356.25/412.5) damage.
Can deal a total of 131.25/262.5/393.75/525 ( 568.75/700/831.25/962.5) damage to a single target (before reductions) with the second meteor hit. Sacred Arrow Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️WR

Instantly kills the first non-ancient creep it hits.

Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
Causes Sacred Arrow to release a Starstorm on enemies along the travel path of the primary arrow, releasing a second Starstorm that deals less damage to the impacted unit.

Modifiers [?]modifier_projectile_visionUndispellable

modifier_stunnedStrongAbility Draft Notes:
 Starstorm must be drafted as well for it to get applied.
Lunar energies make the Princess of the Moon's arrows more deadly than most.


Sacred Arrow travels at a speed of 900, taking 3.41 seconds to travel the full distance.
The arrow starts traveling 51 range in front of Mirana, and travels forward up to 3067 range.
This means units within 50 range in front of Mirana cannot be hit, as it does not search for units right behind the arrow.
With the travel distance and radius, Sacred Arrow can hit units up to 3163 range away.
The stun and damage increases by 0.052/0.068/0.084/0.1 seconds and 3/3.2/3.4/3.6 respectively for each 30 distance traveled, resulting in the following values at certain distances (before reductions):
300 Distance: 0.52/0.68/0.84/1 second stun, 90/182/274/366 damage.
600 Distance: 1.04/1.36/1.68/2 second stun, 120/214/308/402 damage.
900 Distance: 1.56/2.04/2.52/3 second stun, 150/246/342/438 damage.
1200 Distance: 2.08/2.72/3.36/4 second stun, 180/278/376/474 damage.
1500 Distance: 2.6/3.4/4.2/5 second stun, 210/310/410/510 damage.

The arrow reaches max power after traveling for 1500 distance, which takes 1.67 seconds.
The arrow first applies the damage, then the debuff.
The stun duration displayed above the affected target upon hit is truncated, visible to allies only.
If the arrow collides with a unit that is not a hero, ancient creep, or creep-hero, it instantly kills it in the form of HP Removal.
The damage dealt can be defined as expr 100% × CurrentHP
Fully ignores  Couriers, invulnerable and hidden units.
The arrow provides 400 flying vision while traveling, and stays for 3 seconds at the point the arrow hits a target.
SCEPTER Sacred Arrow now releases a primary and secondary meteor based on the current level of  Starstorm onto every enemy that comes within 500 range as the primary arrow travels.
The Starstorm applied by the Sacred Arrow does not cost any mana, and is applied even if the ability itself is currently not castable.
Starstorm notes fully apply.
If the primary arrow lands on a unit, that unit is hit by a secondary meteor that deals 37.5/75/112.5/150 ( 162.5/200/237.5/275) damage.
Can deal up to 112.5/225/337.5/450 ( 487.5/600/712.5/825) against that target, on top of Sacred Arrow's damage (before reductions).
TALENT The multishot  talent launches 2 extra arrows with the primary arrow.
The extra arrows are launched with a 30° angle to the left and right of the primary arrow in the center.
Although all 3 arrows overlap in front of Mirana, they cannot hit the same target.
SCEPTER The Starstorm  Ability Upgrade is not applied to these arrows.
SPELL STEAL  Starstorm applied is based on  Mirana's current ability level when acquired. Leap  Link▶️Link▶️EE

Aghanim's Shard Upgrade:

Upon landing, launches a projectile along Sagan's leap path, dealing damage and slowing units affected and guarantees them to be hit with a secondary Starstorm if that spell is cast. Leap does not break Moonlight Shadow invisibility.
Can be put on alt-cast to choose the distance and facing direction of the jump.

Grants 1 bonus charge(s).

Root Notes:Getting rooted while already leaping does not cancel the leap.Modifiers [?]modifier_mirana_leapDeath

Alt-Cast Icon
Upon learning, Mirana instantly gains 3 charges.
SHARD Acquiring  Aghanim's Shard instantly grants 1 extra charge.
Interrupts Mirana's channeling abilities upon cast.
Leaps at a speed of 1300 for up to 0.44 ( 0.54) seconds.
Always leaps towards the direction Mirana is facing while locking her facing angle during the leap.
Moves Mirana upwards over other units and over impassable terrain.
During Leap, Mirana can attack, use items, and cast abilities, except recasting Leap.
However, she cannot turn, so targeted abilities and items may only be used in the direction she is facing.
The buff is applied instantly upon cast, not upon landing.
The buff of successive casts does not stack but refreshes its duration.
SHARD Upon acquiring the  Ability Upgrade, it has Alt-cast disabled by default.
Mirana now releases a wave that travels at a speed of 1800 in front of her upon landing.
With Alt-Cast activated, Leap now has a point-targeted vector-targeting functionality.
Upon landing, Mirana releases the wave in the targeted direction. This effectively turns and changes Mirana's facing position.
When point-targeted beyond the max leap distance, Mirana leaps forward based on the max distance and releases the wave in front of her regardless of the vector-targeted direction.
The wave takes 0.39 seconds to reach the max distance.
With the travel distance and radius, it can hit units up to 1150 range away.
Leap first applies the damage, then the debuff.
When casting  Starstorm, all units within range and affected by the Leap debuff will be hit with a secondary meteor.
If any enemy unit meets these conditions, a secondary meteor will not also target the closest unit to Mirana.
Same as the the main ability, if the secondary targets die before or because of the first meteor's impact, a new target will be chosen. Multiple secondary impacts can be retargeted onto a single unit. Meaning, if a large number of Leap debuffed creeps are killed by the first Starstorm impact, any surviving units can take massive damage.
SCEPTER Does not affect the Starstorm from  Ability Upgrade arrows. Moonlight Shadow Link▶️RW

Her tenure with Selemene allows Mirana to eclipse the ground, wrapping her allies in a cloak of shadows.


Grants all affected allies an invisibility buff with a 2.5/2/1.5-second fade delay.
As long as the buff is present, the targets will keep turning invisible.
During the fade delay, the target can still cast abilities, use items and perform attacks.
Grants 9%/12%/15% movement speed bonus while fully invisible. The targets can turn, pick up or drop items without breaking the invisibility.
Attacking, casting abilities, or using items breaks the invisibility and resets the fade delay.
Does not grant phased movement.
Invisibility sources with fade delays use the same modifier and do not stack with other invisibility sources of the same type — the longer duration overrides the shorter one.
Fully affects invulnerable and hidden ally heroes.
Treats clones as heroes.
Treats illusions, creep-heroes and the  Wukong's Command Soldiers as creeps.
TALENT The evasion  talent is always present while the ability is active, and does not rely on the invisibility.
Increases Mirana and her team's survivability against physical attacks by 25%.
Evasion uses pseudo-random distribution.
Stacks diminishingly with other evasion sources.
Does not update the current instance of Moonlight Shadow.

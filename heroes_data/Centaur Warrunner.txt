When casting other abilities, including item abilities.
When issuing a Hold Position (H) or Cancel Current Action (S) command.
Additionally, Centaur Warruner is disarmed during the wind-up.

Centaur strikes a mighty blow at melee range, damaging both himself and a small area around the target. Deals extra damage based on your strength. Centaur cannot die from Double Edge.

Causes Double Edge to slow enemy heroes and increase Centaur's strength per hero hit for a short time. Duration refreshes per stack, up to a max of 5 stacks.

modifier_centaur_doubleedge_slowAnyIn the spurs of combat, Bradwarden's vicious strikes sometimes cause self-inflicted collateral damage.


The damage radius is centered around the target, not around Centaur.
Double Edge first apply the movement speed slow, the self Strength bonus, then damage the enemies within the area at a random order, and then the self-damage.
Deals Physical damage to the affected targets and self.
The self-damage is never lethal, so it cannot be used to deny oneself.
SHARD The  strength bonus is only granted when hitting heroes and clones, excluding illusions and creep-heroes.
Each hit enemy hero increases its stack count and refreshes the duration of the entire stack.
Increases the total amount of strength (base and bonus) by 15%/30%/45%/60%/75% with each amount of stacks.
Since Double Edge first applies the strength stacks before the damage, the strength as damage multiplier effectively increases to the following values per stack upon cast:
LEVEL 1 69%/78%/87%/96%/105% ( 103.5%/117%/130.5%/144%/157.5%)
LEVEL 2 103.5%/117%/130.5%/144%/157.5% ( 138%/156%/174%/192%/210%)
LEVEL 3 138%/156%/174%/192%/210% ( 172.5%/195%/217.5%/240%/262.5%)
LEVEL 4 172.5%/195%/217.5%/240%/262.5% ( 207%/234%/261%/288%/315%)

SHARD Effectively increases Centaur Warrunner's health by 22, health regeneration by 0.09 and 1 main attack damage per point of strength.
Upon updating the strength values, Centaur Warrunner's current health stays the same.
These increased stats are removed upon the buff expiring or upon death. He does not keep the current health percentage either.
This health increase does not count as a heal, so it is unaffected by amplifications.
Therefore, the health increase is not considered by  Ice Blast's percentage health kill threshold and  False Promise's delayed health amplification. Retaliate  ER

Bradwarden has no need to parry his opponent's attacks; his armor-like hide does it for him.


Retaliate only triggers when a unit lands an attack, regardless of distance. This means it cannot trigger on missed attacks.
The Retaliate damage is always dealt right before the attacker's damage is dealt to its target.
Can proc on the secondary attacks from other instant attacks.
Except from the following instant attacks that cannot proc attack modifiers:  Split Shot (without the Split Shot uses modifiers  talent) and  Flak Cannon.
Cannot proc on attacks from wards and  Undying Zombies.
Cannot proc on spell damage.
Fully works against buildings and allied units, resulting in a deny if the damage kills the ally.
Deals 7.5/12.5/17.5/22.5 ( 30/35/40/45) + 8%/12%/16%/20%  strength as damage per triggered instance (before reductions) to buildings.
Retaliate is an aura by default, but it affects Centaur Warrunner only, until the  talent is learned. The buff is not visible on self.
Retaliate damage is based on the strength of the target that is attacked, not on Centaur Warrunner's.
The aura's buff lingers for 0.5 seconds.
TALENT Upon learning the Retaliate aura  talent, the aura starts affecting heroes.
Treat clones and creep-heroes as heroes, illusions as creeps.
Affects invulnerable allies, but not hidden allies.
Retaliate damage is still sourced to Centaur Warrunner, and not to the ally bestowing the aura. Work Horse FQ

Requires  Aghanim's Scepter to be unlocked.
Grants only Centaur Warrunner the  Stampede buff based on its current level upon cast.
If Stampede is not learned, Work Horse deals an instance of 0 damage.
Fully procs on-damage effects if no abilities are on cooldown, such as  Corrosive Skin, except those which have a minimum damage threshold (e.g.  Gravekeeper's Cloak).
If cast while already in Stampede, its duration gets extended by the same value instead.
Each successive cast increases the Stampede duration. There is no limit to how often this can be done.
Stampede notes fully apply.
The cart created is always 150 range behind Centaur Warrunner.
The cart has a fixed 8-second duration and the  Hitch A Ride cast does not increase the cart duration.
The ability's cooldown starts upon the cart disappearing, not upon cast.

Centaur tosses an ally into a cart hitched behind him. While in the cart, the ally can still cast and attack normally, but cannot move independently or be targeted by opponents. Non-targeted effects can still affect the hitched ally. Increases the attack range of melee heroes by 200.

Ability Draft Notes:
Requires drafting  Stampede to be unlocked.
The needs of Bradwarden's ample pride pale greatly in the face of his demand for victory.


Requires  Aghanim's Scepter to be unlocked.
Replaces  Work Horse until the sub-ability is used, the ally hero is unmounted, or until the total cart duration ends.
The ally hero is instantly pulled onto the cart, in an arc with a height of ≈110, and varying lengths. The mount always takes 0.5 seconds.
The ally hero is now rooted during the mount duration.
The cart created is always 150 range behind Centaur Warrunner.
Moving beyond this range pulls or turns the cart along with the mounted ally hero.
Since the distance between the ally hero and the cart is 90, the maximum distance between the mounted ally and Centaur is 240.
The cart has a fixed -second duration and the Hitch A Ride cast does not increase the cart duration.
While hitching, the ally hero on the cart is ≈80 distance above the ground.
If the target is already a flying unit or has flying movement while hitching, its total z-axis will be equal to the cart height and the ascending height.
While hitching, the ally hero is phased and fully untargetable.
Any attack or ability targeting the mounted hero that is already in its attack or cast animation gets canceled.
Does not prevent Spell Reflection from reflecting abilities back at the mounted ally hero.
Does not disjoint projectiles.
Certain abilities can bypass unselectability conditionally, while almost every other ability treats the mounted ally hero as if it were invisible.
If Centaur Warrunner teleports a distance greater than 600, the cart disappears and the ally hero is unmounted.
Hitch A Ride has the highest priority in the group position changing effect abilities, making only the following abilities able to unmount the ally:
Teleport sources (e.g.  Blink).
 Walrus PUNCH!,  Walrus Kick,  Pulverize and  Will-O-Wisp.
If the ally hero gets teleported any distance (even at 0 range), the cart disappears.
The cart also disappears when either Centaur or the mounted ally hero dies.
However, the cart does not disappear when Centaur is hidden.
If the caster does not have  Work Horse, Hitch A Ride does nothing to the ally, consuming mana and wasting the cooldown.
SPELL STEAL Does not grant  Work Horse if this sub-ability is the last cast ability. Stampede Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️RT

modifier_centaur_stampede_slowAnyThe great belt of Omexe, which labels Bradwarden as the greatest warrior of his kind, incites his fellow gladiators to follow him into barbarous combat.


Interrupts Centaur Warrunner's channeling abilities upon cast.
Affects every player-controlled allied unit, except for the following units:
 Couriers, wards and buildings.
 Haunt-based illusions.
Uncontrollable units (e.g.  Hawk).
Grants affected allies phased and haste movement, meaning they cannot be slowed below the hasted value.
Affects invulnerable and hidden units as well.
Checks Centaur Warrunner's current  strength whenever trampling an enemy, so it adapts immediately.
However, the strength as damage multiplier is set upon cast and does not adapt upon leveling up the ability.
The strength as damage multiplier is not capped at 0 strength, meaning if the Centaur has negative strength, it deals 0 damage per second.
Fully procs on-damage effects (e.g.  Corrosive Skin) when the caster has 0 strength, except for abilities that have a minimum damage threshold (e.g.  Gravekeeper's Cloak).
Stampede first applies the damage, then the debuff.
The damage is sourced to each buffed ally, meaning certain on-damage effects (e.g.  Blade Mail) react to the buffed ally rather than to Centaur Warrunner.
The sound effect is Global and can be heard by enemies even through the Fog of War.

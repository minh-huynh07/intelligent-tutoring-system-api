The pull duration always takes 0.3/0.4/0.5/0.6 seconds, no matter how far or close the units are from the center, so the pull speed varies.
Affected units are fully disabled during the pull.
Grants affected enemy units phased and unobstructed movement during the pull duration and can pull units over impassable terrain.
Fully affects invisible units.
Does not affect ancient creeps.
Does not affect hidden units and specifically units affected by  Eul's Scepter of Divinity's Cyclone.
Vacuum removes the invulnerability buff of certain non-hidden invulnerable sources, then fully affects the units. This affects the following sources:
Any other Cyclone source, regardless of faction.
 Activate Fire Remnant,  Time Walk,  Reverse Time Walk,  Waveform and  Ball Lightning.
For  Nightmare and  Song of the Siren, Vacuum pulls the affected units but does not removes the invulnerability. If the pull ends during the invulnerability, it does not deal damage.

     Normal Punch illusion as they appear to allies and enemies.  
Requires  Aghanim's Scepter to be unlocked.
Grants Dark Seer's next attack True Strike when not on cooldown. The cooldown triggers upon successfully landing an attack on an enemy.
The bonus damage is applied as spell damage in a separate damage instance, it is affected by spell damage amplification and works with spell lifesteal.
Constantly checks the distance Dark Seer moves and calculates the damage, knockback distance, knockback duration, and stun duration accordingly on each server tick.
For every 10 distance moved, the damage increases by 4, knockback distance by 2.727, knockback duration by 0.006, and stun duration by 0.012.
Teleporting effects (e.g.  Blink) may only add up to 600 range to the distance counter, no matter how big the actual teleported distance was.
Does not consider upward movement distances.
The distance counter never resets, so it is possible to perform multiple full power punches in a row, with cooldown resetting sources.
These are the damage, knockback distance, and stun duration values at certain distances moved in the last 3 seconds (before reductions):
0 distance moved: 10 damage, 50 knockback distance, 0.1s knockback duration, 0.2s stun duration.
180 distance moved: 82 damage, 99.09 knockback distance, 0.206s knockback duration, 0.413s stun duration.
360 distance moved: 154 damage, 148.18 knockback distance, 0.313s knockback duration, 0.625s stun duration.
540 distance moved: 226 damage, 197.27 knockback distance, 0.419s knockback duration, 0.838s stun duration.
720 distance moved: 298 damage, 246.36 knockback distance, 0.525s knockback duration, 1.051s stun duration.
900 distance moved: 370 damage, 295.45 knockback distance, 0.632s knockback duration, 1.264s stun duration.

Normal Punch first applies the stun, the spell damage, the knockback, then the attack damage.
If  Wall of Replica is not learned, the illusion deals 80% damage by default.
The illusion is spawned 350 range behind the enemy's determined landing position,  seconds after Normal Punch was delivered.
The illusion can be controlled normally and is initially ordered to attack the punched target.
Successive punches can create multiple illusions.
The illusion has a expr 2 × IllusionLVL bounty.
Treats clones, illusions and the  Spirit Bear as heroes, and creep-heroes as creeps.
Destroys trees within 100 radius enemies come in contact with during the knockback.
The punch particle and sound effects upgrade when the distance counter is at 300, and upgrade again when at 900.
COSMETIC The invulnerable modifier is responsible for the ability effects upon knocking back an enemy unit.
It is only for cosmetic purposes and has no impact on gameplay. Wall of Replica Link▶️RW

Raises a wall of warping light that slows and creates replicas of any enemy hero who crosses it. Enemy replicas serve at the Dark Seer's will. Replicas last until they are destroyed, or until the wall's duration ends.

modifier_dark_seer_wall_slowAnyThe Dark Seer, while unable to return to his natural realm, can channel part of the prismatic wall with powerful strength of mind, sowing confusion amongst enemy ranks.

     Wall of Replica illusion as they appear to allies and enemies.  
The values of the wall are set upon cast and do not update upon leveling the ability up after having placed the wall.
A wall can only create one illusion per player. There cannot be more than one illusion per player per wall.
This means when there are multiple walls up (with multiple casts), every valid enemy unit affected is still limited to one illusion per wall.
For  Enchanted illusions, the wall still cannot create another illusion until the previous one dies.
When the illusion dies, Wall of Replica creates a new illusion of that hero as soon as it comes in range.
Wall of Replica may create illusions from the following sources:
From real heroes, it does not create illusions of illusions pathing through the wall.
From  Meepo Clones and the  Tempest Double.
From the  Spirit Bear.
From invisible units, but it does not provide vision or True Sight over them.
From invulnerable units, but does not apply the movement speed slow on them.
From untargetable units.
Does not create illusions from hidden units, creep-heroes and from  Wukong's Command Soldiers.
Upon spawning, the created illusions are visually distinguishable and are automatically ordered to attack the heroes they are based on.
Its duration is based on the remaining Wall of Replica duration from which they originate.
They have a static 5  and 5XP bounty which does not scale with levels.
The illusion spawns 108-distance from the affected enemy hero if the target's collision size is 27, and 72-distance if its collision size is 18.
The created illusion appears either north, east, south, or west from the target.
The movement speed slow is applied constantly within the wall's area, provided by an aura. The aura lingers for 1 second.
The slow of multiple overlapping walls does not stack.

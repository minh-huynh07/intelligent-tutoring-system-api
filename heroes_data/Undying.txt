[?]modifier_undying_decay_buff_counterdeath modifier_undying_decay_buffdeath modifier_undying_decay_debuff_counterdeath modifier_undying_decay_debuffdeaththe strength of the living is simply borrowed from the strength of the dead. successive casts of decay fully stack on the targets and on undying. there is no limit to how much this can be done. decay first steals the strength, then applies its damage. despite the visual effects, the stolen strength is gained instantly. level 1 deals 0 damage to affected units and fully procs on-damage effects (e.g. corrosive skin), except for abilities that have a minimum damage threshold (e.g. gravekeeper's cloak). strength steals cannot reduce a hero's strength below 0, but undying always gains the full amount of strength, no matter how much the target has left. cannot steal strength from illusions, but can temporarily steal from clones. when multiple meepo clones are in the area, one of them, randomly chosen on each cast, gets their strength stolen. the same applies to arc warden and the tempest double. however, the damage still hit all affected targets. reduces the target's current and max health by 88 ( 176), instead of keeping the current health percentage. the lost current health is not returned when the debuff expires on enemy heroes. this means decay effectively deals up to 88/128/168/208 ( 138/178/218/258 or 226/266/306/346) damage (before reductions). can deal up to 0/80/160/240 ( 100/180/260/340) to creeps. treat creep-heroes as creeps. the target also effectively loses 0.36 ( 0.72) health regeneration and 4 ( 8) main attack damage if it is a strength hero. temporarily increases undying's both current and max health, health regeneration, and main attack damage by the same amount per cast. undying does not keep the current health percentage either. this affects the following things: in this example, undying has a current and max health of 520/920 and has one stack of decay buff without the ability upgrade. without accounting for health regeneration values, his current and max health will be increased to 608/1008. with aeon disk equipped after receiving the buff, his current and max health will be increased to 773/1258. this health increase does not count as a heal, so it is unaffected by health-based amplifications and can bypass health freeze sources. each stack places a new hidden modifier buff/debuff on both undying and the target. this means their durations are independent of each other. the counter modifiers on both undying and his targets show how much strength they gained or lost. the number of stolen strength stacks can be seen on the status buff icon. each status buff increases undying's model size by 2%. this has no impact on his collision size. upon death, the dying hero's strength restores back to its normal values, while undying keeps the bonus strength values for the remaining duration. scepter upon acquiring or losing aghanim's scepter, all stacks of stolen strength instantly update to the current values. upon updating the strength values, undying's current health stays the same. however, debuffed enemies keep their current health percentage. their health also only updates upon gaining or losing max health again. soul rip link wr abilitytarget unit affectsenemies / allies(tombstone) damagemagical undying rips health away from all nearby units and uses it to heal an ally, or damage an enemy. soul rip can also be used to heal tombstone. cast animation: 0.3+0cast range: 750search radius: 1300damage per unit: 15/25/35/45 (

value.spell block / reflection notes:blocked upon cast.nearby units counted toward damage/heal still lose health.even allies feel despair in undying's presence. double-tapping automatically targets self. can cast on tombstone regardless of factions, but not on any other ward type unit. when cast on an allied tombstone, it always increases its attacks to destroy value for 4/8/12/16 hero attacks, regardless of unit count. this is not considered as heal. can target enemy tombstone, but does not damage or heal it. cannot cast on undying zombie. the 1300 search radius is always centered on undying, even when targeting other units. units within the radius are selected randomly and have their health set to 15/25/35/45 ( 25/35/45/55) lower than the previous amount. the health cost counts as setting health and is thus never lethal. does not count undying, the target, enemy couriers, wards, buildings, invisible, untargetable enemies and units in the fog of war. spell immune and untargetable allies are counted, including ally couriers and the undying zombies from tombstone. units that require a certain amount of attacks to be killed and familiars do not lose health when counted in by soul rip. if there are no valid units within the search radius, no damage or healing is done. the damage or heal value is dependent on the number of units affected within the radius. it is then summed up and the target receives the total value in one instance. always heals for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much health is set from affected targets. soul rip can damage or heal a unit for up to 150/250/350/450 ( 250/350/450/550) health (before reductions). tombstone link link link et abilitytarget point ( target unit / passive) affectsenemies ( allied heroes) summons a tombstone at the target point. zombies will frequently spawn next to every enemy unit in the area around the tombstone, and attack them. zombies have the deathlust ability, which causes their attacks to slow the target, and if the target reaches below a certain amount of health, increases the attack and movement speed of the zombie. passive component number of tombstone on death:

cannot leave for 3 seconds nor can they re-enter after leaving. if the tombstone is destroyed with a hero inside, that hero gets stunned for 3 seconds. debuff immunity notes:undying zombie spawns for

ally spell immunity notes spawns undying zombie within the radius. destroys trees within 300 radius around the tombstone upon cast. the tombstone spawns facing the same direction as undying. undying zombies do not spawn for invisible units or units in the fog of war. zombies also do not spawn for wards, buildings, courier, hidden, untargetable units and zombies from an enemy tombstone. however, they spawn for invulnerable and ethereal units. they are uncontrollable and do nothing but attack their set target. however, they can be boosted by allied abilities or auras. the tombstone starts spawning zombies immediately upon cast, resulting in 8/9/10/11 instances. a player may only have up to 64 zombies under their control, no matter how many tombstones they summon. the zombies and their set target have the following interactions: when the set target turns invisible, the associated zombies die after 0.1 seconds. does not die when set target turns untargetable. when the set target dies, including with reincarnation, the associated zombies die instantly. however, with meepo clones dying, the zombies stand around until the tombstone expires. when the set target turns invulnerable, ethereal, hidden, untargetable, or is affected by the fog of war, the associated zombies will still follow it. when the tombstone expires or is destroyed, all its zombies instantly die. both the tombstone and the undying zombie treats attacks from roshan, illusions and creep-heroes as creeps. treats attacks from clones and towers as heroes. tombstones can also be affected by soul rip and decrepify, regardless of source. cosmetic the pale mausoleum and golden pale mausoleum can spawn two types of undying zombies, either a crawling zombie or a walking zombie. the zombie types are only for cosmetic purposes and have no impact on gameplay. shard adds an ally-only unit-targeting functionality to the ability, casting tombstone on an ally instantly bunkers them in it. double-tapping automatically targets self. cannot be cast on allies who have disabled help from undying. can be cast on invulnerable or invisible allies, but not hidden ones. treats meepo clones and the spirit bear as heroes. treats other clones, creep-heroes and illusions as creeps. a tombstone can only bunker 1 ally hero at a time. ally heroes can right click or issue a move order (m) on the tombstone, within 350 range, to be entombed inside. tombstones have an ally-only visual indicator indicating that they can be bunkered in. the tombstone has a different model and looks fortified while an ally hero is entombed inside it. multiple tombstones can each bunker its own ally hero, with the same restrictions. the ally hero entombed is invulnerable, hidden, and spell immune, they are silenced, muted and rooted for its entomb duration and are prevented from acting until exiting the tombstone. shard the ally exits the tombstone if either: they issue any order after at least 3 seconds since their entry. another ally enters the tombstone. the tombstone is destroyed, denied, or expires. after the bunkered ally hero exits the tombstone, they are restricted from reentering any tombstone for 3 seconds. shard upon tombstone expiring, the tombstone first ejects the bunkered hero out, destroys itself, and does not stun the ally hero. however, destroying or denying the tombstone with an ally hero inside stuns the bunkered hero for 3 seconds. talent the zombie damage increasing talent instantly updates all current active zombies. the tombstone on death talent summons one tombstone based on its current level passively and instantly on undying's death location whenever he dies. the tombstone lasts its full duration, it is not bound to undying's death timer and does not disappear when he respawns. the passive cast on death does not trigger the cooldown and work while on cooldown, and do not cost mana. they do not proc on-cast effects either. it also triggers with reincarnation sources. the tombstone attacks to destroy increasing talent does not update the current active tombstone instance. flesh golem link link link rf abilityno target affectsenemies / self

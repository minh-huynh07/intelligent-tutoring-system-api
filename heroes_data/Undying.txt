Undying steals strength from all enemy heroes in an area, dealing base damage as he claims the enemy's strength for himself. Deals 2x damage to creeps.

Successive casts of Decay fully stack on the targets and on Undying. There is no limit to how much this can be done.
Decay first steals the  strength, then applies its damage.
Despite the visual effects, the stolen strength is gained instantly.
LEVEL 1 Deals 0 damage to affected units and fully procs on-damage effects (e.g.  Corrosive Skin), except for abilities that have a minimum damage threshold (e.g.  Gravekeeper's Cloak).
Strength steals cannot reduce a hero's strength below 0, but Undying always gains the full amount of strength, no matter how much the target has left.
Cannot steal strength from illusions, but can temporarily steal from clones.
When multiple  Meepo Clones are in the area, one of them, randomly chosen on each cast, gets their strength stolen.
The same applies to  Arc Warden and the  Tempest Double.
However, the damage still hit all affected targets.
Reduces the target's current and max health by 88 ( 176), instead of keeping the current health percentage.
The lost current health is not returned when the debuff expires on enemy heroes.
This means Decay effectively deals up to 88/128/168/208 ( 138/178/218/258 or  226/266/306/346) damage (before reductions).
Can deal up to 0/80/160/240 ( 100/180/260/340) to creeps.
Treat creep-heroes as creeps.
The target also effectively loses 0.36 ( 0.72) health regeneration and 4 ( 8) main attack damage if it is a strength hero.
Temporarily increases Undying's both current and max health, health regeneration, and main attack damage by the same amount per cast.
Undying does not keep the current health percentage either. This affects the following things:
In this example, Undying has a current and max health of 520/920 and has one stack of Decay buff without the  Ability Upgrade.
Without accounting for health regeneration values, his current and max health will be increased to 608/1008.
With  Aeon Disk equipped after receiving the buff, his current and max health will be increased to 773/1258.
This health increase does not count as a heal, so it is unaffected by health-based amplifications and can bypass health freeze sources.
Each stack places a new hidden modifier buff/debuff on both Undying and the target. This means their durations are independent of each other.
The counter modifiers on both Undying and his targets show how much strength they gained or lost.
The number of stolen strength stacks can be seen on the status buff icon.
Each status buff increases Undying's model size by 2%. This has no impact on his collision size.
Upon death, the dying hero's strength restores back to its normal values, while Undying keeps the bonus strength values for the remaining duration.
SCEPTER Upon acquiring or losing  Aghanim's Scepter, all stacks of stolen strength instantly update to the current values.
Upon updating the strength values, Undying's current health stays the same.
However, debuffed enemies keep their current health percentage. Their health also only updates upon gaining or losing max health again. Soul Rip  Link▶️WR

Undying rips health away from all nearby units and uses it to heal an ally, or damage an enemy. Soul Rip can also be used to heal Tombstone.

↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
Can cast on  Tombstone regardless of factions, but not on any other ward type unit.
When cast on an allied Tombstone, it always increases its attacks to destroy value for 4/8/12/16 hero attacks, regardless of unit count. This is not considered as heal.
Can target enemy Tombstone, but does not damage or heal it.
Cannot cast on  Undying Zombie.
The 1300 search radius is always centered on Undying, even when targeting other units.
Units within the radius are selected randomly and have their health set to 15/25/35/45 ( 25/35/45/55) lower than the previous amount.
The health cost counts as setting health and is thus never lethal.
Does not count Undying, the target, enemy  Couriers, wards, buildings, invisible, untargetable enemies and units in the Fog of War.
Spell immune and untargetable allies are counted, including ally Couriers and the Undying Zombies from Tombstone.
Units that require a certain amount of attacks to be killed and  Familiars do not lose health when counted in by Soul Rip.
If there are no valid units within the search radius, no damage or healing is done.
The damage or heal value is dependent on the number of units affected within the radius. It is then summed up and the target receives the total value in one instance.
Always heals for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much health is set from affected targets.
Soul Rip can damage or heal a unit for up to 150/250/350/450 ( 250/350/450/550) health (before reductions). Tombstone   Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️ET

Zombies also do not spawn for wards, buildings,  Courier, hidden, untargetable units and zombies from an enemy Tombstone.
However, they spawn for invulnerable and ethereal units.
They are uncontrollable and do nothing but attack their set target. However, they can be boosted by allied abilities or auras.
The Tombstone starts spawning zombies immediately upon cast, resulting in 8/9/10/11 instances.

The zombies and their set target have the following interactions:
When the set target turns invisible, the associated zombies die after 0.1 seconds.
Does not die when set target turns untargetable.
When the set target dies, including with Reincarnation, the associated zombies die instantly. However, with  Meepo Clones dying, the zombies stand around until the Tombstone expires.
When the set target turns invulnerable, ethereal, hidden, untargetable, or is affected by the Fog of War, the associated zombies will still follow it.
When the Tombstone expires or is destroyed, all its zombies instantly die.
Both the Tombstone and the Undying Zombie treats attacks from  Roshan, illusions and creep-heroes as creeps.
Treats attacks from clones and Towers as heroes.
Tombstones can also be affected by  Soul Rip and  Decrepify, regardless of source.
COSMETIC The  Pale Mausoleum and  Golden Pale Mausoleum can spawn two types of Undying Zombies, either a crawling zombie or a walking zombie.

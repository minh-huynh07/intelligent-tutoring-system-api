his powers for enjoyment. the lift duration consists of 0.65/0.9/1.15/1.4 seconds static air time and 0.3 seconds landing time. the lifted unit is stunned while in the air and is not affected by the area stun upon landing. the stun modifier is always placed as a debuff, while the main modifier is based on the alliance of the target. shard this means the stun can be dispelled with strong dispels when casting on allies or self, while the lift itself cannot. since the lift itself does not disable the target, allies can attack, turn, and cast abilities and items during the lift if the stun gets dispelled. while in the air, other units may pass below the lifted unit. when the lift ends prematurely, the lifted unit instantly lands and applies the area stun and damage. telekinesis first applies the stun, then the damage. cannot lift roshan, he will be stunned for the lift duration instead. casting telekinesis on units affected by black hole, chronosphere or duel does nothing, wasting the mana and cooldown. with arcane supremacy, telekinesis has the following cast ranges with arcane supremacy on each level: level 1 610/670/730/790 cast range. level 2 635/695/755/815 cast range. level 3 660/720/780/840 cast range. level 4 685/745/805/865 cast range. shard telekinesis uses the reduced cooldown when targeting self or allies, and the regular cooldown when targeting enemies. double-tapping automatically targets self. can be cast on ally couriers. spell steal this ability is not acquirable. morph notes can be reflected but not castable on rubick. telekinesis land qz

poof, boundless strike, teleportation, requiem of souls, assassinate and blast off!. for assassinate, once the item is equipped, it no longer uses the cast point for acquired abilities since the upgrade changes the cast point. the stolen ability's channeling notes fully apply. sub-abilities from abilities are automatically acquired (e.g. ethereal jaunt) and cannot be manually stolen. the sub-ability of the acquired ability takes the same slot and is automatically swapped in upon casting the acquired ability. abilities granted by aghanim's scepter and aghanim's shard are considered stand-alone abilities, and can be acquired without having the respective item equipped. any illusion creating abilities create illusions of rubick based on the intended visual appearance, and not of the original hero. for ability interactions with summoned and dominated units, the following rules generally apply: units with limited duration (e.g. holy persuasion and chaotic offering etc.) are not killed upon losing the ability. units with permanent duration (e.g. summon familiars are killed upon losing the ability unless stated otherwise. stolen channeling abilities usually end prematurely when he loses them during channeling, which has the same effect as being interrupted during channeling. however, there are a few exceptions as listed here. for transformation abilities (e.g. shapeshift), rubick uses the transformation time of the ability and is not transformed instantly. multiple transformation abilities can be stolen, and their bonuses and/or reductions fully stack with each other. attack range definitions from their ability notes fully apply. items that use different values for melee and ranged heroes (e.g. manta style) to now treat rubick's ranged type based on the ability notes. if a stolen transformation ability benefits illusions, they will do so when illusions of rubick are created, no matter how many transformation abilities are stacked. visually, rubick is transformed into a smaller version of the original, and into the form of the last cast transformation ability. except for metamorphosis, which has priority over every other transformational ability. this also applies to attack projectiles. if the ability expires, the previous cast's attack projectiles will be used. since spell steal can only be cast on heroes, non-hero abilities from neutral creeps (i.e. ensnare) cannot be directly acquired, except under the following conditions: doom casts the gained ability from devour. clinkz casts the gained ability from death pact. the acquired neutral abilities use the original cast point of the neutral creeps they come from. however, the cast backswing differs depending on the ability acquired (see chart). expr cast point: original cast

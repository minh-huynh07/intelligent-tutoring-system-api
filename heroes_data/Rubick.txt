The lift duration consists of 0.65/0.9/1.15/1.4 seconds static air time and 0.3 seconds landing time.
The lifted unit is stunned while in the air and is not affected by the area stun upon landing.
The stun modifier is always placed as a debuff, while the main modifier is based on the alliance of the target.
SHARD This means the stun can be dispelled with strong dispels when casting on allies or self, while the lift itself cannot.
Since the lift itself does not disable the target, allies can attack, turn, and cast abilities and items during the lift if the stun gets dispelled.
While in the air, other units may pass below the lifted unit.
When the lift ends prematurely, the lifted unit instantly lands and applies the area stun and damage.
Telekinesis first applies the stun, then the damage.
Cannot lift  Roshan, he will be stunned for the lift duration instead.
Casting Telekinesis on units affected by  Black Hole,  Chronosphere or  Duel does nothing, wasting the mana and cooldown.
With  Arcane Supremacy, Telekinesis has the following cast ranges with  Arcane Supremacy on each level:
LEVEL 1 610/670/730/790 cast range.
LEVEL 2 635/695/755/815 cast range.
LEVEL 3 660/720/780/840 cast range.
LEVEL 4 685/745/805/865 cast range.

SHARD Telekinesis uses the reduced cooldown when targeting self or allies, and the regular cooldown when targeting enemies.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
Can be cast on ally  Couriers.

Therefore, the speed varies between 0 ‒ 1250 ( 2583.33), depending on the chosen distance.
Can be cast multiple times during the lift. The enemy lands at the last chosen location.
When cast while the target is already being moved to a previously targeted point, it continues moving to that previous point.
However, upon reaching it, the target is instantly teleported to the last targeted location.
The center of the targeted area is marked with green particles, which are visible to allies only.
Destroys trees within 300/325/350/375 radius of the lifted target upon landing.

Targeting further than the maximum allowed throw distance throws the ally 506.25 ( 1046.25) distance towards the targeted point.
The ally moves towards the targeted point during the last 0.3 seconds of the lift duration.
Therefore, the speed varies between 0 ‒ 1687.5 ( 3487.5), depending on the chosen distance.

Can be used while stunned, cycloned, slept, taunted, hidden, or during Forced Movement.

The cooldown and charges of stolen abilities are saved. Re-acquiring an ability does not reset its previous cooldown or charges, with some exceptions listed here.
Rubick gets the same initial charges when the ability is learned for charge-based abilities.
Cooldown resetting effects have no effect on the cooldowns of abilities Rubick currently does not have.
Sets the cast point to  for stolen abilities if the stolen ability's original cast point is higher than the set value.
However, this neither affects abilities with 0 cast point nor with  instant cast point.
The following abilities tagged with DOTA_ABILITY_BEHAVIOR_NORMAL_WHEN_STOLEN do not get their cast point modified upon acquired:
 Terrorize,  God's Rebuke,  Poof,  Boundless Strike,  Teleportation,  Requiem of Souls,  Assassinate and  Blast Off!.
For   Assassinate, once the item is equipped, it no longer uses the cast point for acquired abilities since the upgrade changes the cast point.
The stolen ability's channeling notes fully apply.
Sub-abilities from abilities are automatically acquired (e.g.  Ethereal Jaunt) and cannot be manually stolen.
The sub-ability of the acquired ability takes the same slot and is automatically swapped in upon casting the acquired ability.
Abilities granted by  Aghanim's Scepter and  Aghanim's Shard are considered stand-alone abilities, and can be acquired without having the respective item equipped.
Any illusion creating abilities create illusions of Rubick based on the intended visual appearance, and not of the original hero.
For ability interactions with summoned and dominated units, the following rules generally apply:
Units with limited duration (e.g.  Holy Persuasion and  Chaotic Offering etc.) are not killed upon losing the ability.
Units with permanent duration (e.g.  Summon Familiars are killed upon losing the ability unless stated otherwise.
Stolen channeling abilities usually end prematurely when he loses them during channeling, which has the same effect as being interrupted during channeling. However, there are a few exceptions as listed here.
For transformation abilities (e.g.  Shapeshift), Rubick uses the transformation time of the ability and is not transformed instantly.
Multiple transformation abilities can be stolen, and their bonuses and/or reductions fully stack with each other.
Attack range definitions from their ability notes fully apply. Items that use different values for  melee and  ranged heroes (e.g.  Manta Style) to now treat Rubick's ranged type based on the ability notes.
If a stolen transformation ability benefits illusions, they will do so when illusions of Rubick are created, no matter how many transformation abilities are stacked.
Visually, Rubick is transformed into a smaller version of the original, and into the form of the last cast transformation ability. Except for  Metamorphosis, which has priority over every other transformational ability.
This also applies to attack projectiles. If the ability expires, the previous cast's attack projectiles will be used.
Since  Spell Steal can only be cast on heroes, non-hero abilities from neutral creeps (i.e.  Ensnare) cannot be directly acquired, except under the following conditions:
 Doom casts the gained ability from  Devour.
 Clinkz casts the gained ability from   Death Pact.
The acquired neutral abilities use the original cast point of the neutral creeps they come from. However, the cast backswing differs depending on the ability acquired (see chart).

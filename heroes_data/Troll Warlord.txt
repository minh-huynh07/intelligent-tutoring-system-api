This ability is not available in Ability Draft.
Like his anger, Troll Warlord's supply of axes is infinite.

While active.
Casting the following abilities affects Berserker's Rage current ability toggle status:
 Whirling Axes (Melee) toggles Berserker's Rage On if not already.
 Whirling Axes (Ranged) toggles Berserker's Rage Off if not already.
Does not interrupt Troll Warlord's channeling abilities upon toggling.
Toggling On disables  Whirling Axes (Ranged) and then enables  Whirling Axes (Melee).
Turns Troll Warlord into a  melee unit with 150 attack range, and sets his base attack time to 1.4 while active.
This causes items that use different values for melee and ranged heroes (e.g.  Manta Style) to now treat the caster as a melee hero.
Attack range bonuses are not overridden and still work normally.
Increases Troll Warlord's total movement speed to 305/315/325/335 ( 330/340/350/360).
When toggling On while a  ranged projectile is airborne, the projectile is treated as a melee attack by items, but it does not proc Berserker's Rage's root chance.
These attacks landed are also considered as  melee attacks, and therefore using  melee values (i.e. can cleave, bash etc.).
However,  Quelling Blade uses the ranged values if Troll Warlord is in ranged form at the start of the projectile.
Berserker's Rage  melee and  ranged form persists through Troll Warlord's death. He respawns with the same form as he dies.
The root proc is decided upon the attack point if Troll Warlord is in  melee form.
The root proccing attack first applies the debuff, then its own damage.
Provides True Sight over the target for its duration.
Berserker's Rage's proc chance uses pseudo-random distribution.
The root does not work against wards, buildings, and allied units.
When toggled Off, all changes are reverted and he becomes a  ranged unit again.
SPELL STEAL All ability effects apply upon toggling On / Off. However, upon toggling Off and as long as the acquired ability is not lost,  Rubick is considered  melee hero. He still attacks with 550 attack range, the attacks are Instant and do not have a projectile, his attacks cannot miss uphill and are treated as a  melee hero by items. Upon losing the spell, Rubick becomes a   ranged hero once again regardless of toggle state. Whirling Axes (Ranged) Link▶️Link▶️WE

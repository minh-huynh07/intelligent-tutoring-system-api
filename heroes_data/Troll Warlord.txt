berserker's rage link link link qg abilitytoggle affectsself / enemies while active, troll warlord swaps from using ranged to melee attacks. melee attacks have a chance to ensnare, preventing the target from moving or using mobility spells. berserker's rage also grants additional movement speed, armor, and decreases base attack time.whirling axes has different functionality while berserker's rage is active. cast animation: 0+0armor bonus: 4/5/6/7 ( 14/15/16/17)move speed bonus: 15/25/35/45 ( 40/50/60/70)attack range loss: 350base attack time: 1.4root chance: 14%/16%/18%/20%root duration:

his anger, troll warlord's supply of axes is infinite. while active. casting the following abilities affects berserker's rage current ability toggle status: whirling axes (melee) toggles berserker's rage on if not already. whirling axes (ranged) toggles berserker's rage off if not already. does not interrupt troll warlord's channeling abilities upon toggling. toggling on disables whirling axes (ranged) and then enables whirling axes (melee). turns troll warlord into a melee unit with 150 attack range, and sets his base attack time to 1.4 while active. this causes items that use different values for melee and ranged heroes (e.g. manta style) to now treat the caster as a melee hero. attack range bonuses are not overridden and still work normally. increases troll warlord's total movement speed to 305/315/325/335 ( 330/340/350/360). when toggling on while a ranged projectile is airborne, the projectile is treated as a melee attack by items, but it does not proc berserker's rage's root chance. these attacks landed are also considered as melee attacks, and therefore using melee values (i.e. can cleave, bash etc.). however, quelling blade uses the ranged values if troll warlord is in ranged form at the start of the projectile. berserker's rage melee and ranged form persists through troll warlord's death. he respawns with the same form as he dies. the root proc is decided upon the attack point if troll warlord is in melee form. the root proccing attack first applies the debuff, then its own damage. provides true sight over the target for its duration. berserker's rage's proc chance uses pseudo-random distribution. the root does not work against wards, buildings, and allied units. when toggled off, all changes are reverted and he becomes a ranged unit again. spell steal all ability effects apply upon toggling on / off. however, upon toggling off and as long as the acquired ability is not lost, rubick is considered melee hero. he still attacks with 550 attack range, the attacks are instant and do not have a projectile, his attacks cannot miss uphill and are treated as a melee hero by items. upon losing the spell, rubick becomes a ranged hero once again regardless of toggle state. whirling axes (ranged) link link we abilitytarget point / target unit affectsenemies / self damagemagical troll hurls a fistful of five axes in a cone shape over 950 range, slowing

max distance in 1.5 seconds, and then returning to troll warlord at the same speed. the axes always spawn towards east and west at troll warlord's position and rotate clockwise. with the max spin

stacks stop providing attack speed. modifiers [?]modifier_troll_warlord_fervordeath if at first you don't succeed, strike, strike again. troll warlord gains or loses stacks as soon as his attacks land on the target. this means that missed or disjointed attacks do not count, and in ranged form, it reacts on projectile hit, not on launch. when already having stacks, the first attack against a new target removes the previous stacks, without granting a new stack. attacks redirected by bulwark counts as attacking a new target. grants attack speed bonus against any unit, including allies, wards and buildings. grants up to 180/240/300/360 ( 240/320/400/480) attack speed at max stacks. talent with the attack speed increasing talent, fervor can grant up to 240/300/360/420 ( 320/400/480/560) attack speed at max stacks. for how much attack speed bonus fervor grants with a certain amount of stacks on each level, please refer to the chart below. shard fervor neither procs on nor attacks the same target if the primary target is the lone target within the search radius. the search radius can be further increased by other attack range bonuses. does not proc on instant attacks. an additional attack proc is determined during troll warlord's attack point. attacks missed or disjointed on the primary target do not prevent fervor from hitting the secondary target. shard causes troll warlord to perform a ranged-projectile instant attack on a visible secondary target within 1 radius, prioritizing heroes. the instant attack can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. they do not have true strike. conditional attack damage bonus (e.g. shadow walk) are also applied to the secondary target on proc. works with both lifesteal and spell lifesteal sources. fully affect enemy couriers. for melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss. treats illusions and buildings as heroes. treats and creep-heroes as creeps. does not consider ward-type units, beetles and phantoms as valid secondary targets, unless they are the primary target without other valid units within the search radius. shard with max stacks, fervor has a 84% proc chance. the proc chance uses pseudo-random distribution, while the secondary targets are chosen randomly. battle trance link link rr abilityno target affectsself troll unleashes a

while not attacking, troll warlord automatically chooses a valid attack target, including couriers, within the search radius. the cast backswing is immediately interrupted upon cast when there are enemies within the search radius. prioritizes heroes over other units. uses standard auto-attack rules to decide for attack targets. does not target roshan, buildings, wards, allies, sleeping, invulnerable, hidden or attack immune enemies. treats creep-heroes as creeps. when cast while already attacking a target, troll warlord sticks to that target, even if it is roshan, buildings, wards, or an ally. troll warlord only switches the current attack target when it dies, or becomes unattackable from turning invulnerable or attack immune. grants shared vision over the current attack target as long as he stays within 900 range of the target, revealing it through the fog of war. does not provide true sight. battle trance orders and forces troll warlord to attack the target automatically every server tick. only the following abilities can be cast while attacking: toggling berserker's rage . whirling axes (ranged) and whirling axes (melee). other abilities with 0-cast point or instant cast time can also be cast while attacking. while battle trance is active, troll warlord also does not need to turn to cast the aforementioned abilities within its cast range. while attacking, troll warlord becomes almost fully uncontrollable. grants troll warlord haste and phased movement, while completely ignoring taunts. fear sources stop him from attacking and cause conflicting movements. when no enemies are nearby, he becomes controllable and can be affected by movement speed slows again, until another visible enemy enters the search radius. prevents troll warlord from dying by setting his minimum health to 1. this affects the following things: troll warlord cannot die to damage, including hp removal sources: false promise's delayed damage. stops ice blast kill health threshold from killing him. however, it does not protect him against certain instant kill sources: culling blade's kill threshold when wraith delay expires. damage received is not reduced, all damage events still register the full damage. battle trance can only be dispelled by an ally dismember or an ally supernova. talent the battle trance strong dispel talent turns the basic dispel into a strong dispel. also allows battle trance to be cast while stunned, cycloned, taunted, slept, hidden, or during forced movement. does not allow it from being cast while silenced, hexed or prevented from acting. troll warlord is unable to shift-queue this ability upon learning the talent.

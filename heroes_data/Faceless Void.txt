time, passing through claszureme, and appearing back in an instant. places a damage counter on faceless void upon learning the ability. time walk moves faceless void with a speed of 3000. faceless void turns invulnerable during time walk. upon cast, any damage faceless void took in the last 2 ( 2.5) seconds gets healed back up. heals from all 3 damage types, including damage from allies, but not from heals and hp removal sources (e.g. sunder etc.). does not disjoint projectiles upon cast. does not travel the full distance, when targeting closer than the max distance. does not dispel status buffs and debuffs. neither affect ability cooldowns nor restore mana. scepter 0.4 seconds after cast, time walk applies time lock based on its current level on every enemy within 400 radius at the destination point. does not perform instant attacks to trigger the time lock. instead, the force proc modifier is applied on enemies, which makes time lock trigger on them. this means time lock applied this way cannot proc more than once, and it does not affect couriers. despite not performing instant attacks, for melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss. dispelling this debuff does not remove the time lock stun, but it prevents the time lock instant attack from occurring. fully affects hidden or ethereal units and units in the fog of war at the landing destination, but not invisible units. with the max travel distance and effect radius, time lock can be applied to units up to 1050/1100/1150/1200 ( 1200/1250/1300/1350) distance away. if time lock is not leveled, it is not applied. time dilation link link wr abilityno target affectsenemies damagemagical faceless void traps all nearby enemies in a

modifier_faceless_void_time_dilation_slowanyfor those facing off against darkterror, each moment seems to stretch into eternity. affects units in the fog of war and invisible units, but not invulnerable and hidden units. causes enemy cooldowns and charge-based abilities to recharge 30%/40%/50%/60% slower while they have the debuff. affects cooldowns of passive abilities as well, but not item ability cooldowns. abilities affected by time dilation can still be reset (e.g. refresher orb). the debuff applied has no stack limit, and the number of stacks can be seen on the status buff icon. each ability on cooldown adds a stack. also counts the cooldown of the following hidden/acquired abilities: abilities acquired via devour. spirit form abilities. previously invoked abilities. abilities acquired from the morphed targeted. abilities acquired via spell steal. losing already granted abilities by aghanim's scepter (e.g. putting item in backpack, selling, etc.). time dilation's debuff value does not include acquired abilities on cooldown and already lost, as they are not hidden, but removed. also, it does not include abilities that are unaffected by cooldown manipulation. the debuff checks all cooldowns continuously and adapts the slow and damage values and stack count immediately. successive casts do not stack but refresh the duration. also refreshes the debuff duration for enemy units affected by chronosphere, effectively extending the duration at most for 3.75/4.25/4.75 seconds. talent both the damage per second and movement and attack speed slow increasing talents do not update already existing debuffs on enemies. deals damage in 1.1-second intervals, starting 1.1 seconds after the debuff is placed, resulting in up to 7/8/9/10 + 3/3/4 possible instances. can deal up to the following amount of damage (before reductions) with a certain amount of ability cooldowns, considering the cooldowns are present for the entire duration: 1x :

innately disabled for faceless void, even if time lock isn't leveled up. the proccing attack first applies the debuff, then its own damage. 0.4 seconds after proccing, time lock causes faceless void to perform an instant attack on the target. this instant attack can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally, including time lock itself. they do not have true strike, but ignore disarms. if the caster is a ranged hero, the instant attacks use their attack projectile. cleave effects are based on faceless void's position and not the position of the image of him that appears. death does not prevent the proccing attack from applying time lock on the affected target. the bash damage is also dealt 0.4 seconds after proccing, in a separate instance, and counts as spell damage. fully works with spell damage amplification and spell lifesteal, but not affected or considered by anything that works with attack damage. time lock first applies the spell damage, then the instant attack. the bash duration treats illusions, creep-heroes, roshan and couriers as heroes. procs an average of 0.1364/0.1905/0.25/0.3158 times on a single attack. adds an average of 13.64%/19.05%/25%/31.58% attack damage + 1.36/2.86/5/7.9 ( 5.46/8.57/12.5/17.37) magical damage to every attack. the instant attack and spell damage is independent of the stun debuff and happens even if it gets dispelled. time lock works against couriers, but not against wards and buildings. time lock uses pseudo-random distribution. talent the damage increasing talent immediately updates already procced instances of time lock. reverse time walk link dd abilityno target affectsself available for seconds after landing time walk. if used in this period, you will reverse your time walk back to your previous cast location. does not affect health or proc scepter hits. cast animation: 0+0reversal time window: 1.5 0.5 0ability draft notes: replaces time walk while active, instead of being in a separate slot. requires aghanim's shard to be unlocked. this sub-ability stays inactive until time walk is cast and turns inactive again once the reversal time window pass. cooldown resetting sources (e.g. refresher orb) immediately turns this sub-ability inactive. upon cast, moves faceless void back to where he was as he cast time walk, using the same travel speed. successive time walk casts within 1.5 seconds, moves faceless void back to the first point before time walk was cast, upon casting reverse time walk. neither disjoint projectiles, nor reverse anything else. the health change upon time walk is not reversed, and the time lock bash from the upgrade does not proc. chronosphere link rc abilitytarget area affectsenemies / allies creates a blister in spacetime, trapping all units caught in its sphere

claszureme, all poor souls caught within will likely never return. chronosphere freezes all units which are not owned by faceless void, including buildings, wards, and allies. does not affect

instantly destroy homing missiles and beetles latched before chronosphere. however, beetles that are still traveling can latch on to units within the chronosphere without being destroyed. instantly causes already latched phantoms to return to their caster, and freezes traveling phantoms. instantly unperch units on trees with tree dance. affected units are stunned within the radius. time dilation debuff on affected units can be also extended for 3.75/4.25/4.75 seconds. when other units are moved into the effect radius, they are also affected for the remaining duration. only enemies' abilities' cooldowns, including the charge replenish time, are paused for the duration. grants faceless void and his player-controlled units haste and phased movement while in the chronosphere. faceless void and all illusions based on him, regardless of faction, are innately immune to chronosphere's disable. however, the haste and phased movement is only provided to the caster and their units. provides 475 radius flying vision over the center of the affected area for its duration. it also provides true sight within 500 ( 640) radius for its duration. chronosphere reveals proximity mines and units affected by the following abilities: blur, disguise and solitary disguise. cancels most sources of forced movement upon applying the disabling debuff on a unit. most abilities or items can move units out of chronosphere, except the following: force boots, force staff, hurricane pike, psychic headband, geomagnetic grip, dispose telekinesis, firesnap cookie and snowball. despite its visual effects, the effective area is a cylinder and not a sphere. therefore, it unperches tree dance targets on trees. cosmetic has a cast backswing of 0.6 with claszian apostasy equipped. talent the attack speed

draft notes: this talent is available and it is not bound to any ability. grants faceless void a chance to avoid damage completely. backtrack fully negates damage (after all reductions), causing several on-damage effects to not trigger. it is not evasion. this means it only negates damage, it does not evade any side effects of abilities or attacks (e.g. stuns, etc.). for example, an attack with attack modifiers hit faceless void, and backtrack triggers on the attack, the damage is avoided while the attack modifier still takes effect. therefore, true strike or accuracy does not stop backtrack from avoiding attack damage. however, evasion has priority over backtrack. when evasion procs, backtrack cannot proc on that attack. backtrack has priority over damage barriers, negating the damage before it gets blocked by the barriers. as with all damage manipulating effects, backtrack can negate all damage types, but not heals and hp removal effects (e.g. sunder). increases faceless void's effective health by an average of 25% against those damage types. on average, backtrack increases faceless void's survivability against all damage by 25%. backtrack uses pseudo-random distribution.

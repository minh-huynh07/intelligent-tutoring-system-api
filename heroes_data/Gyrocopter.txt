damage instantly, rather than on each rocket's impact. neither hit invisible units nor units in the fog of war. the units damaged are selected randomly within the search radius. there are no priorities. does not fire rockets while gyrocopter is hidden. deals damage in 0.1-second intervals, starting 0.1 seconds after cast, resulting in 30 damage instances. can deal a total of 240/420/600/780 ( 660/840/1020/1200) damage (before reductions), assuming all rockets hit. leveling up the ability does not update the current active instance. stacks multiplicatively with other slow

stationary missile is placed 150 range in front of gyrocopter, which begins to move 2.5 seconds later. homing missile has an initial speed of 500 and increases by 15 per second, increasing by 1 movement speed every 0.07 seconds. the speed acceleration is not capped and continues to increase until it hits the target or is destroyed. if the missile's target dies, it automatically switches to the nearest valid target within 700 range of the previous target, prioritizing heroes. if there are no other valid targets, it is instantly destroyed. only attacks from heroes, illusions, towers and fountain, can damage the missile. the missile can be pushed forward or backward by force staff, hurricane pike and psychic headband. the missile cannot impact the target while being affected by the aforementioned forced movement sources. it passes through, reorients, and continues to chase the target. the missile is instantly destroyed if targeted by force boots and when affected by chronosphere. heroes and buildings deal 33.33 and 16.67 damage respectively to the homing missile. treats attacks from clones and illusions as heroes. creeps do not attack homing missile. the rocket first applies the debuff, then the damage. the cross-hair over the target is visible to allies only. although the ability neither grants vision nor true sight over the target, the missile homes and hits invisible units. provides 400 radius flying vision over the hit target. the vision lingers for 3.5 seconds. leveling up ability does not update the current active flying missiles. shard homing missile starts firing rocket barrage of the current level, second after being deployed. this rocket barrage has a radius of and prioritizes its current target over other units. rocket barrage notes fully apply. if it is not leveled, rocket barrage's animation will still fire at the target but deal no damage. although the missile launches the rocket barrage, the damage is sourced to gyrocopter, and not to the homing missile. therefore, the damage is affected by outgoing damage manipulation and spell lifesteal. acquiring aghanim's shard immediately updates all currently existing homing missiles. spell steal the rocket barrage applied is based on gyrocopter's current ability level when acquired. soulbind the second homing missile is launched after the first hit its target or is destroyed. flak cannon link link ef abilityno target ( passive) affectsenemies / self damage instant attack gyrocopter's attacks hit all enemy units in an area around it for a limited number of

channeling abilities upon cast. increases gyrocopter's nighttime vision range to 1000 upon cast. causes gyrocopter to perform instant attacks on all nearby enemies whenever he launches an attack projectile. this means it does not matter if the attack successfully hits or not. the instant attacks do not trigger attack modifiers or any on-hit effects. they do not have true strike. the projectiles from the active instant attacks travel at a speed of 800. the flaks have no count limit. all valid nearby targets get targeted. the primary attack target is not affected by flak cannon. it is only hit by the primary attack. does not target couriers, wards, buildings, invisible units, or units inside the fog of war. however, attacking couriers, wards, buildings, or allied units still causes flaks to hit all valid targets within the search radius. the visual effect above gyrocopter and the number of attacks left on the buff icon are visible to everyone. scepter adds a passive component to flak cannon, with the active components still present. therefore, the side cannon ability upgrade requires flak cannon to be learned to work. passively perform instant attacks, using gyrcopter's current projectile speed, on the furthest enemy within 700 range of him. while flak cannon is active, gyrocopter attacks 2 enemy units within range simultaneously. these instant attacks can trigger any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally, except for flak cannon while it is active. they do not have true strike, but ignore disarms. instant attacks launched this way neither interrupt gyrocopter's channeling abilities nor interrupt his attack orders. does not target wards, couriers or attack immune enemies, but does target buildings. only targets units gyrocopter has vision over. does not launch attacks when gyrocopter is hidden or invisible. the side gunner ignores fade times and fade delays of invisible sources. it stops launching instant attacks when gyrocopter is fully invisible. for melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss. talent both the attack damage bonus and number of attacks increasing talents do not update the current active instance. grants flat bonus attack damage while flak cannon is active. call down link link rc abilitytarget point / vector targeting affectsenemies

vision at the targeted area upon cast with each missile. each missile impacts for 1 seconds after cast. additional instances of call down are launched in 1 intervals, starting 1 seconds after the primary call down, taking 3 seconds to launch them all. the additional instances are launched along the selected vector, 500 range apart from each other, so that they overlap a bit. this results in them covering a total area with a length of 1800 and a width of 400. once cast, the additional instances cannot be stopped in any way, not even by gyrocopter's death. can deal a total of 750/1200/1650

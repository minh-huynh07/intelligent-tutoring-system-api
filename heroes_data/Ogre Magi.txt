TALENT Grants Fireblast a 17% chance to passively proc on regular attacks.

Ignite travels at a speed of 1000.
The second projectile only targets enemies that do not have the Ignite debuff yet.
If multiple enemies that are not ignited yet are within range, it chooses the closer target for the second projectile.
Cannot target invisible, invulnerable, or hidden units, or units inside the Fog of War.
Can target secondary untargetable units from  Shadows and  Shadow Realm.
When  Multicast, Ogre Magi launches Ignite projectiles in 0.6-second intervals at random enemy or neutral units within 1400 range.
The multicasts launch 2 projectiles per cast as well, just like a regular cast.
Prioritizes units without the Ignite debuff.
Cannot target invisible, invulnerable, or hidden units, or units inside the Fog of War.
If there are multiple valid targets, the next multicasted Ignite in a single multicast sequence will not target the same target as the last Ignite.
Can hit the same unit multiple times.
The debuff from Ignite does not stack with itself.
However, successive instances increase the duration of the existing debuff, instead of refreshing it.
Deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting immediately as the debuff is placed.
When  Multicast onto the same target, each projectile applies a damage tick on impact.
However, the tick timer gets reset on each impact as well, so that all but 1 of the ticks on impact get canceled out, resulting in an average up to:
Without Multicast, it deals 6/7/8/9 damage instances for a total of 120/210/320/450 ( 210/315/440/585) damage (before reductions).

The number of remaining attacks is visualized by the visual effect, with one fire orb orbiting the unit for each remaining instance.
A number on the status buff shows the remaining charges as well.

While this ability is available for leveling for Ogre Magi, it doesn't do anything.
Despite being largely incapacitated by his IQ, the Ogre Magi's success in battle is attributed to pure skill.


When targeting enemies, Multicast can proc on unit-targeted active item abilities, including neutral items.
Only procs if the targeted unit is an enemy, even for items that can target allies or trees.
Multicast items only target enemies, even when the item itself can target allies by default.
Cannot affect the same unit again per item ability cast.
The item's notes and targeting restriction fully apply (e.g. Items that can only target creeps cannot Multicast on enemy heroes.).
Does not proc for  Helm of the Dominator-based and  Urn of Shadows-based items.
Visually proc for Urn of Shadows-based items, but its ability effects are not multiplied by Multicast.
The Multicast item range can be defined as expr ItemCastRange + CastRangeBonus + 600
Multicast is resolved in a single roll, rolling from the highest chance to the lowest. This results in the following distribution for each level:
0x: 25%/25%/25%
2x: 75%/45%/45%
3x: 0%/30%/15%
4x: 0%/0%/15%
This means each ability is cast 1.75/2.05/2.2 times on average.
Ally  Couriers are not valid targets for  Bloodlust and  Fire Shield Multicasts.
SOULBIND Procs independently for both enemies bound per ability cast.

when primary target.modifiers [?]modifier_zuus_arc_lightningundispellable arc lightning is zeus' favorite spell to use against puny mortals. the lightning bounces in 0.25-second intervals, so hitting all targets takes 1/1.5/2/3.5 seconds. does not bounce on invisible units or units in the fog of war. can never hit the same unit twice per cast. all bounces together can deal up to 425/770/1215/2400 base damage (before reductions). the current health as damage is dealt together with the base damage as a single spell damage instance. the hidden buff is required for the lightning to jump. talent the current health as damage increasing talent immediately update the current active instances. lightning bolt link wg abilitytarget point / target unit( target area) affectsenemies damagemagical calls down a bolt of lightning to strike an enemy unit, causing damage and a mini-stun. when cast, lightning bolt briefly provides unobstructed vision and true sight around the target in a 750 radius.

first applies the damage, then the debuff. when unit-targeted, the 750 range flying vision and true sight are provided at the target's position upon cast. the vision is stationary and does not follow the target. when ground-targeted, lightning bolt searches for any enemy unit within its area. chooses the closest target to the center. prioritizes heroes, including illusions, clones, and creep-heroes. it does not require any vision or true sight to hit invisible or enemies in the fog of war. with the cast range and search radius, it can hit an enemy up to 1025/1075/1125/1175 range away. when cast this way, the vision, and true sight is always centered on the targeted point, regardless of hitting a unit. the flying vision and true sight last for 5 seconds. the true sight is provided by an aura, and its debuff lingers for 5 seconds. the lightning particles and sound effects during the cast time are visible and audible to everyone. talent the area of effect talent turns lightning bolt into a 325 radius area-targeted ability, so that it cannot directly target units anymore. lightning bolt now hits every enemy unit within the search radius. does not hit invulnerable or hidden enemies, but still hits invisible enemies and enemies inside the fog of war. scepter does not upgrade the lightning bolts of lua error in module:ability_id at line 61: could not find cargo data

(prioritizing heroes), dealing damage, reducing their movement, attack speed and increasing their cast time. if zeus was moving forward, he will jump forwards that direction. zeus gets 900

abilities upon cast. leaps at a speed of 1000 over 0.5 seconds. always leaps towards the direction zeus is facing while locking his facing angle during the leap. moves zeus 250 range upwards over other units and over impassable terrain. during leap, zeus can attack, use items, and cast abilities. however, he cannot turn, so targeted abilities and items may only be used in the direction he is facing. casting heavenly jump while already leaping has no effect, wasting the mana and cooldown. heavenly jump provides 900 radius flying vision for 3 seconds at the cast location upon cast. this vision is stationary and does not follow zeus. 0.13 seconds after cast, heavenly jump deals damage and applies the debuff to 1 ( 2) closest enemies within its search radius. can target any unit, but prioritizes heroes, including illusions, clones, and creep-heroes. does not target invulnerable, invisible, or hidden enemies. debuff and buff of successive casts do not stack but refresh its duration instead. talent increases zeus' total movement speed to 345 upon cast. the buff is applied instantly upon cast, not upon landing. the buff of successive casts does not stack but refreshes its duration. heavenly jump first applies the debuff, the damage, and then movement speed increasing buff. nimbus link link dt abilitytarget area affectsenemies damagemagical creates a storm cloud

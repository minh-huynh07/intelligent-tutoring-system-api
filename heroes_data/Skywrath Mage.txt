325 radius flying vision. this vision does not linger. also provides the same vision at the target's location for 3.34 seconds upon successfully hitting it. checks skywrath mage's intelligence upon releasing the projectile. this means that the projectile's damage is set upon launch and does not adapt when losing or gaining intelligence. this is how much damage arcane bolt deals with a certain amount of intelligence (before reductions): level 1 (23 ): 110/130/150/170 damage level 5 (39 ): 134/154/174/194 damage level 10 (59 ): 165/185/205/225 damage level 15 (80 ): 196/216/236/256 damage

value of successive casts on the same target does not stack but refreshes the duration. scepter whenever arcane bolt is cast, 3 different random targets within the search radius, prioritizing heroes, are also targeted by other arcane bolts. the search radius is centered around the primary target, not around skywrath mage. since it uses a defined radius and is not based on the cast range, it is not affected by cast range modifying abilities (e.g. aether lens). treats clones and illusions as heroes and creep-heroes as creeps. the other arcane bolts are released only if valid targets are found within the search radius. talent fully affects couriers upon learning the arcane bolt pierces spell immunity talent. soulbind considers the extra arcane bolt casts of the ability upgrade as being unit-targeted directly by skywrath mage. this means that if both bounded heroes are targeted by the first set of bolts, a total of 3 sets of bolts will be cast. concussive shot link link wt abilityno

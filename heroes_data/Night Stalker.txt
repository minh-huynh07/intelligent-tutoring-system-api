It is a humbling sight to see when the mightiest of warriors become afraid of the dark.


Time of Day modifying abilities has the following priorities:  Supernova ➤  Eclipse ➤ Dark Ascension.
The ability's bonuses are not disabled during Supernova's  daytime. However, the vision is limited to Night Stalker's default daytime vision.
Eclipse does not interfere with the  nighttime caused by Dark Ascension in any way — they do not cancel or pause each other's nighttime.
Upon cast, the hero model and hitbox of Night Stalker ascends 150 units above the z-axis.
However, its collision size is still on the ground. This does not change the current absolute coordinates of the model as well.
Grants flying vision based on the caster's current vision range for its duration.
For Night Stalker, Dark Ascension grants  1800 flying vision.
Resets the current cooldowns of all the caster's basic abilities upon cast.
Neither reset ultimate abilities nor item abilities.
Does not reset charges for charged-based abilities.
Destroys trees within a 150 radius at the end of the duration.
Always replaces the game clock's  daytime or  status with  Night Stalker's minimap icon regardless of the caster.
SPELL STEAL  Rubick neither ascends above the z-axis nor turns into a flying unit.

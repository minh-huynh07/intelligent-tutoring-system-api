[?] health regain this way is considered as setting health. has no effect on affected units' current mana percentage if intelligence is reduced. debuffs of successive casts stack additively, with each cast placing a new debuff with its duration independent of each other. the attribute reduction fully affects illusions, meepo clones and the tempest double. timber chain link link link wt abilitytarget point affectsself / enemies(trees) damagephysical timbersaw fires a chain that embeds itself in the first tree it hits, pulling him towards it. any enemy in the path takes damage. cast

you never know when you might need to escape from malevolent saplings. the chain travels at a speed of 2200/2400/2600/2800 and always travels either the full distance or until connecting with a tree. with the maximum travel distance and tree search radius, it can connect to trees up to 840/990/1140/1290 ( 1965/2115/2265/2415) range away. the hooked tree is destroyed once the chain stops pulling. fully damages invisible and untargetable units. can pull timbersaw over impassable terrain and through trees. timbersaw stops being pulled if he is disabled at any point during timber chain. if timbersaw is disabled before the chain starts pulling, the chain still pulls him for a very short distance. this is still enough to cause damage around him to nearby units or to interact with distance-based ability effects (e.g. rupture). timbersaw is disarmed, but he can cast abilities during the pull. the chain's tip briefly provides 100 radius ground vision around itself while traveling, and 400 radius ground vision once reaching maximum distance or connecting with a tree. reactive armor link link ee abilitypassive ( no target) affectsself ( enemies) damage physical each

[?]modifier_shredder_reactive_armorundispellable modifier_shredder_reactive_armor_stackdeath modifier_shredder_reactive_armor_bombany the saw-suit is equipped to react to the slightest touch with fortified defenses. reactive armor only triggers when a unit lands an attack, regardless of distance. this means it cannot trigger on missed attacks. the reactive armor stack is always granted right before the attacker's damage is dealt to timbersaw. does not trigger on instant attacks that cannot proc attack modifiers (e.g. split shot before learning the split shot uses modifiers talent and flak cannon). can trigger on attacks from wards, buildings and allies. each stack has its own duration and is independent of other stacks. the amount of stacks is shown on the status buff icon. treats clones, illusions and creep-heroes as heroes. at max stacks, reactive armor grants 6/12/19.8/29.4 ( 8.4/15/23.4/33.6) bonus armor and 4.5/9.6/16.5/25.2 ( 6.3/12/19.5/28.8) bonus health regeneration on each level. can regenerate up to 45/115.2/231/403.2 ( 72/172.8/330/554.4) health over its full duration. for how much armor and health regeneration bonus a certain amount of reactive armor stacks on each level grants, including the max stacks increasing talent, please refer to the chart below. the amount of stacks is also visually indicated by a dome that closes over on timbersaw. the exhaust on the suit also starts emitting fire once the dome is fully closed. the dome has 4 fragments, each appearing for every 4 stacks (1 4, 5 8, 9 12, 13 16). the dome opens again upon dropping below the given amount of stacks. scepter adds an active component to reactive armor, with the passive effects still present. interrupts timbersaw's channeling abilities upon cast. a timer above timbersaw's head shows how much time is left before the damage barrier blows up. this timer is visible to everyone. scepter grants timbersaw a universal damage barrier that absorbs damage values of all damage types (after all reductions), causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity. stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources. universal damage barrier has the lowest priority in the group of damage barriers, its capacity is depleted last when combined with other damage-type barriers. however, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g. refraction), reactive armor does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire. the pure damage barrier has a 200 base capacity, and gradually increases up to 800 capacity based on the number of enemy heroes within 600 radius. the capacity increases and regenerate in 0.1-second intervals, up to 17.5/25/32.5/40/47.5 capacity per interval with 5 heroes within the radius. enemy heroes leaving or entering the area after cast fully affects the capacity increase and regeneration value. treat clones and creep-heroes as heroes, and illusions as creeps. scepter dispelling the reactive armor buff removes the damage barrier, causes it to burst and deal area damage prematurely. this includes timbersaw dying while the buff is active, it instantly blows up, damaging enemy units around timbersaw based on the current remaining capacity. the area damage (before reductions) can be defined as expr 200 + currentcapacity successive casts refreshes the max stack duration and the buff duration, while delaying the explosion time. second chakram link link df abilitytarget area affectsenemies /

returns to timbersaw. while traveling towards the target point, the blade deals pass damage, and movement speed slows on enemy units within range once. upon reaching the target area, the chakram deals 25/37.5/50 damage (before reductions), and drains 7/11/15 of timbersaw's mana in 0.5-second intervals, starting 0.5 seconds after reaching the target area. the chakram also applies a movement speed slow aura to enemies which lingers for 0.5 seconds. the chakram stops draining mana and dealing damage over time as soon as it starts to return. while returning, the chakram deals the pass damage to nearby units again and slows enemy units' movement speed by placing a debuff again. the movement speed slow from the chakram passing, in both directions, lasts 0.5 seconds. the movement speed slow debuff from passing and from the stationary aura is the same. however, the former is dispellable, the latter is not. a passing chakram first applies the passing damage, then the debuff. the passing damage may only damage the same unit once when flying toward the targeted point, and once again when returning. the chakram returns to timbersaw in the following conditions: upon using the return

cinder brew's projectiles travel at a speed of 1600. despite the visual effect, cinder brew does not launch a single projectile toward the center of the targeted area. instead, it launches individual projectiles on every enemy and brewmaster within the area. these projectiles are invisible and disjointable. this means cinder brew's targets are decided upon ability cast, and not upon the visible effect reaching the targeted area. it also means that enemies entering the area after the cast are not affected, while enemies leaving the area after the cast are still affected. does not affect invisible, invulnerable or hidden units. however, it fully affects untargetable units. the ignition damage on the affected enemy starts upon receiving a spell damage instance of magical or pure damage types with the cinder brew debuff, the duration of the debuff gets extended by 3, then the ignition damage starts. the debuff may be ignited only once. the debuff still slows after getting ignited. does not react on abilities with the hp removal flag (e.g. heartstopper aura etc.) and instant attack sources. the damage interval is based on the debuff's duration, so it always deals 8 instances of damage. each instance deals 10/20/30/40 ( 13/26/39/52) damage. successive casts onto the same units neither stack nor update its ability values, but refresh the duration instead. successive casts on an already ignited enemy refresh the ignited debuff instead. the ignition is not reset. once ignited, the damage interval does not update. the amount of intervals is hard-coded, so it continues to deal damage until the debuff expires. the cinder brew buff duration can be also ignited when brewmaster receives any incoming spell damage. talent the cinder brew fear applies fear on enemies once the debuff gets ignited, making them run towards their fountain and preventing them from acting. drunken brawler link eb abilityno target / passive affectsself / enemies brewmaster can switch stances based on the elements he controls gaining passive bonuses that improve against enemies when brewed up.earth stance - grants 1/3/5/7/9 armor and 4%/8%/12%/16%/20% magic resistance. bonuses are 2.5x when brewed up.storm stance - grants 10%/15%/20%/25%/30% evasion and 4%/6%/8%/10%/12% bonus move speed. bonuses are 2.5x when brewed upfire stance grants 20% chance to crit for 120%/135%/150%/165%/180% of your attack damage and 10/15/20/25/30 attack speed. chance is 2.5x when brewed up.void stance - grants 4%/6%/12%/16%/20% bonus status resistance to brewmaster and applies a 5%/10%/15%/20%/25% slow for 2s on attack. slow and status resistance are 2.5x when affected by cinder brew. passive componentcinder brew multiplier: 2.5 ( 3.5)cast animation: 0+0earth stance armor bonus: 1/3/5/7/9earth stance magic resistance bonus: 4%/8%/12%/16%/20%storm stance evasion: 10%/15%/20%/25%/30%storm stance move speed bonus: 4%/6%/8%/10%/12%fire stance critical chance: 20%fire stance critical damage: 120%/135%/150%/165%/180%fire stance attack speed bonus: 10/15/20/25/30void stance status resistance bonus: 4%/6%/12%/16%/20%void stance move speed slow: 5%/10%/15%/20%/25%void stance slow duration: 2 0 0debuff immunity notes:the slow debuff does not pierce debuff immunity.illusion notes:illusions do not copy the current stance on creation, and are always on earth stance.cast event notes:does not proc on-cast effects despite being a toggle-able ability.modifiers [?]modifier_brewmaster_drunken_brawler_passiveundispellable modifier_brewmaster_drunken_brawler_slowanyability draft notes: toggling autocast on swaps this ability out with primal companion.checks for the current level of the ultimate ability drafted by the player, instead of checking specifically for primal split. when mangix won his title as the brewmaster of the order of oyo, he also claimed his place in the mastery of inebriation. icon statuses:earth stancestorm stancefire stancevoid stance interrupts brewmaster's channeling abilities upon changing stances. switch stances as follows: earth stance storm stance fire stance void stance earth stance the particle effects around brewmaster indicate the current stance he is in. earth stance grants 2.5/7.5/12.5/17.5/22.5 ( 3.5/10.5/17.5/24.5) armor and 10%/20%/30%/40%/50% ( 14%/28%/42%/56%) magic resistance while affected by cinder brew. stacks multiplicatively with other magic resistance sources. increases brewmaster's magic resistance to 28%/31%/34%/37%/40%. with the magic resistance bonus from this source, every 10 points of intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 0.96%/0.92%/0.88%/0.84%/0.8%.

primal split. if either ability is not leveled, nothing happens upon cast, wasting the mana and cooldown. the ability icon also changes accordingly to the current drunken brawler stance. the brewling is spawned 100 range in front of brewmaster's cast location, and its facing angle equals brewmaster's facing angle upon cast. the brewling does not bestow any aura brewmaster has. does not update any values of already summoned brewlings upon leveling up the ability. casting primal companion replaces all existing brewling from a previous cast, creating new ones based on the current level of primal split and resetting the cooldown of all brewlings' abilities. primal split also resets the cooldown of primal companion upon cast. despite the ability's tooltip, the brewlings' abilities do not have a cooldown penalty. the brewlings are also not disarmed despite having a disarm indicator when they are outside of the penalty distance. a brewling cannot be re-summoned if it has taken player-based damage in the last seconds. has no minimum damage threshold. damage is checked before any sort of reduction, so fully blocked damage also prevents re-summoning it. the cooldown is unaffected by

potent bond with nature, as it often occurs in the midst of a drunken stupor. primal split formation the brewlings always spawn in the same formation, forming a square formation that fits within a 100-radius circle. the brewlings face the same angle as brewmaster upon cast. earth and void are spawned 100 range north and south brewmaster's cast location respectively. fire and storm are spawned 100 range east and west of brewmaster's cast location respectively. brewmaster is invulnerable and hidden during the split time and duration. does not apply dispel upon cast. during primal split, brewmaster is periodically moved to earth's position. if earth dies, brewmaster is moved to storm's position; if both earth and storm die, he is moved to fire; if earth, storm, and fire all die, he is moved to void. in short, brewmaster is moved according to the following sequence unless he is dead: earth storm fire void earth. shard this affects brewmaster's re-appearing position when the primal split cancel sub-ability is used as well. this brewling priority and sequence affect the following things: earth is selected by default upon cast, and can tab through units in the aforementioned order. every aura brewmaster has (e.g. gem of true sight etc.) is bestowed around the current brewling he is moved to. ability effects that interact with heroes' presence (e.g. smoke of deceit, blur etc.) react on the current brewling he is moved to. during primal split, brewmaster dies when all brewlings are killed. the kill is credited to the hero who kills the last brewling. once the duration ends, brewmaster appears at the place of the current brewling he is moved to. teleporting abilities (i.e. relocate) cause the periodic moving of brewmaster to get canceled, so the notes above do not apply anymore. the brewlings are summoned ancient creep-heroes, making them interact differently with several abilities. the brewlings are unable to activate runes. casting primal split replaces all existing brewlings from a previous cast or from a primal companion cast, creating new ones based on the current level and resetting the cooldown of all brewlings' abilities. scepter also resets the cooldown of primal companion upon cast. spell steal grants drunken brawler upon acquiring this ability. primal split cancel rr abilityno target affectsself cancel the primal split cast animation: 0+0

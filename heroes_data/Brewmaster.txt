Cinder Brew's projectiles travel at a speed of 1600.
Despite the visual effect, Cinder Brew does not launch a single projectile toward the center of the targeted area.
Instead, it launches individual projectiles on every enemy and Brewmaster within the area.
These projectiles are invisible and disjointable.
This means Cinder Brew's targets are decided upon ability cast, and not upon the visible effect reaching the targeted area.
It also means that enemies entering the area after the cast are not affected, while enemies leaving the area after the cast are still affected.
Does not affect invisible, invulnerable or hidden units.
However, it fully affects untargetable units.
The ignition damage on the affected enemy starts upon receiving a spell damage instance of magical or pure Damage types with the Cinder Brew debuff, the duration of the debuff gets extended by 3, then the ignition damage starts.
The debuff may be ignited only once. The debuff still slows after getting ignited.
Does not react on abilities with the HP Removal flag (e.g.  Heartstopper Aura etc.) and instant attack sources.
The damage interval is based on the debuff's duration, so it always deals 8 instances of damage. Each instance deals 10/20/30/40 ( 13/26/39/52) damage.
Successive casts onto the same units neither stack nor update its ability values, but refresh the duration instead.
Successive casts on an already ignited enemy refresh the ignited debuff instead. The ignition is not reset.
Once ignited, the damage interval does not update. The amount of intervals is hard-coded, so it continues to deal damage until the debuff expires.
The Cinder Brew buff duration can be also ignited when Brewmaster receives any incoming spell damage.
TALENT The Cinder Brew Fear  applies fear on enemies once the debuff gets ignited, making them run towards their fountain and preventing them from acting. Drunken Brawler    Link▶️EB

Ability Draft Notes:
Requires drafting  Drunken Brawler to be unlocked.
Mangix doesn't hold to it by rule, but he vaguely recalls an old master musing that, if one could manage, scaring up a companion was always preferable to drinking alone.

 Icon statuses:Earth StanceStorm StanceFire StanceVoid Stance
Requires  Aghanim's Scepter to be unlocked.
Summons a Brewing based on current  Drunken Brawler Stance and current level of  Primal Split.
If either ability is not leveled, nothing happens upon cast, wasting the mana and cooldown.
The ability icon also changes accordingly to the current Drunken Brawler Stance.
The Brewling is spawned 100 range in front of Brewmaster's cast location, and its facing angle equals Brewmaster's facing angle upon cast.
The Brewling does not bestow any aura Brewmaster has.
Does not update any values of already summoned Brewlings upon leveling up the ability.
Casting Primal Companion replaces all existing Brewling from a previous cast, creating new ones based on the current level of Primal Split and resetting the cooldown of all Brewlings' abilities.
Primal Split also resets the cooldown of Primal Companion upon cast.
Despite the ability's tooltip, the Brewlings' abilities do not have a cooldown penalty.
The Brewlings are also not disarmed despite having a disarm indicator when they are outside of the penalty distance.
A Brewling cannot be re-summoned if it has taken player-based damage in the last  seconds. Has no minimum damage threshold.
Damage is checked before any sort of reduction, so fully blocked damage also prevents re-summoning it.
The cooldown is unaffected by cooldown reduction. However, it is affected by cooldown resetting.
The following damage sources do not trigger the damage cooldown:
HP Removal sources.
Damage from buildings, lane creeps and neutral creeps.
Losing Aghanim's Scepter instantly kills the summoned Brewling.
Does not trigger 70 seconds cooldown if Brewling was killed with  Ice Blast debuff

It isn't clear whether Mangix is consciously aware of his potent bond with nature, as it often occurs in the midst of a drunken stupor.

     Primal Split Formation  
The Brewlings always spawn in the same formation, forming a square formation that fits within a 100-radius circle.
The Brewlings face the same angle as Brewmaster upon cast.
 Earth and  Void are spawned 100 range north and south Brewmaster's cast location respectively.
 Fire and  Storm are spawned 100 range east and west of Brewmaster's cast location respectively.
Brewmaster is invulnerable and hidden during the split time and duration. Does not apply dispel upon cast.
During Primal Split, Brewmaster is periodically moved to Earth's position.
If Earth dies, Brewmaster is moved to Storm's position; if both Earth and Storm die, he is moved to Fire; if Earth, Storm, and Fire all die, he is moved to Void.
In short, Brewmaster is moved according to the following sequence unless he is dead: Earth ➜ Storm ➜ Fire ➜ Void ➜ Earth.
SHARD This affects Brewmaster's re-appearing position when the  Primal Split Cancel sub-ability is used as well.
This Brewling priority and sequence affect the following things:
Earth is selected by default upon cast, and can Tab ↹ through units in the aforementioned order.
Every aura Brewmaster has (e.g.  Gem of True Sight etc.) is bestowed around the current Brewling he is moved to.
Ability effects that interact with heroes' presence (e.g.  Smoke of Deceit,  Blur etc.) react on the current Brewling he is moved to.
During Primal Split, Brewmaster dies when all Brewlings are killed. The kill is credited to the hero who kills the last Brewling.
Once the duration ends, Brewmaster appears at the place of the current Brewling he is moved to.
Teleporting abilities (i.e.  Relocate) cause the periodic moving of Brewmaster to get canceled, so the notes above do not apply anymore.
The Brewlings are summoned ancient creep-heroes, making them interact differently with several abilities.
The Brewlings are unable to activate runes.
Casting Primal Split replaces all existing Brewlings from a previous cast or from a  Primal Companion cast, creating new ones based on the current level and resetting the cooldown of all Brewlings' abilities.
SCEPTER Also resets the cooldown of Primal Companion upon cast.

During the fade time, Storm can cast abilities and perform attacks without breaking the invisibility.
Both attacks during the fade time and the attack breaking invisibility apply 140/200/260 conditional attack damage bonus to the target.
The attack damage bonus is not applied when attacking buildings, but is applied against wards.
Although the attack damage bonus values are not displayed in the HUD, it is still considered and directly added to Storm's attack damage.
The damage is considered by critical strike, lifesteal and cleave, and it can be reduced only by flat reductions (e.g. damage block).
Since it is considered bonus attack damage, it is not affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions.
The invisibility is lost upon reaching the cast point of abilities, or upon launching an attack.
This means when the attack misses, the invisibility is still lost.

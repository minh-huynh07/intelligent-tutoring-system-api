resolve in combat. the projectile travels at a speed of 1400. grants the allied unit that is attacking the debuffed enemy the attack speed buff upon its attack point (i.e. starting an attack). this includes invulnerable and hidden units, as well as buildings and wards. the buff is granted even if the attacks missed or changing targets after the attack point. once gained, the buff stays for its full duration, so it can be used against other targets. does not apply to instant attacks. when leveling up the ability while a cast is already active, the ability values on already affected units do not update to the new values. successive casts also do not update existing ability values but refresh the duration. penitence first applies the debuff, then the damage. chen has a total of 700/800/900/1000 attack range against the affected target. grants chen and his controlled ranged units attack range bonus as long as they are attacking the affected unit with attack range bonus buff,

and max health are increased by the difference. this counts as setting health and does not count as a heal. leveling the ability or the min health increasing talent does not update the health of already persuaded creeps. fully restores the creep's mana upon persuading by setting mana. grants flat bonus attack damage to the persuaded creeps. reinforced units receive 10% less damage (before reductions) from persuaded creeps. scepter acquiring aghanim's scepter retroactively grants the martyrdom ability to the persuaded creeps. does not require hand of god to be leveled to be unlocked, once aghanim's scepter is acquired. however, it relies on hand of god to work, since it directly uses its values. this means when hand of god is not learned, martyrdom does nothing upon cast. shard ancient creeps can now be persuaded, with a max of 1/2/3 ancient creeps per level of hand of god. ancient creeps are included in the max units count as well, so it does not allow chen to have more creeps persuaded. when persuading an ancient creep while already having the maximum amount of ancient creeps, the oldest persuaded ancient creep dies. if hand of god is not learned, holy persuasion can still be cast on ancient creeps, but it does nothing, wasting the mana and cooldown. with level 4 holy persuasion, chen can persuade the following number of creeps and ancient creeps on each level of hand of god: level 1 max 3 creep(s) with 1 ancient creep(s). level 2 max 2 creep(s) with 2 ancient creep(s). level 3 max 1 creep(s) with 3 ancient creep(s). spell steal persuaded units are killed

leveled to be unlocked. this ability is granted to the persuaded creeps once aghanim's scepter is acquired. if the caster does not have hand of god, nothing happens upon cast. when losing aghanim's scepter, the ability disappears immediately from the persuaded creeps. the initial damage and damage per second component is sourced to chen, and not to the persuaded unit. therefore, the damage is affected by outgoing damage manipulation and spell lifesteal. although martyrdom uses hand of god's ability values, amplifying or reducing the healing value neither affects the impact damage nor the damage per second component. deals damage in 1-second intervals, 1 second after cast, the impact damage is applied together with the first damage per second instance, resulting in 8 damage instances. uses the same debuff with hand of god's buff, therefore it can replace the buff which is recevived before. martyrdom's cooldown is shared among all persuaded units. it is possible to have different

Damage Instant Attack

Fires Hoodwink's attack with an acorn at the target unit. The acorn bounces to nearby targets, slowing them and dealing a percentage of Hoodwink's attack with bonus damage.If point targeted, a tree is created at the target position and the acorn will bounce to nearby targets. The ability may be placed on auto-cast to force this behavior.

Alt-Cast Icon
Acorn Shot's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster, as well as cast range bonuses.
With the ability's own attack range bonus, Acorn Shot effectively has a cast range of 700/775/850/925 on Hoodwink.
Cast range bonus from  Scurry does not apply to Acorn Shot.
However, attack range bonus from  Scurry applies.
LEVEL 4 Acorn Shot with activated  Scurry has a cast range of 975/1025/1075/1125.
When ground-targeted, a tree gets planted upon reaching that point. Planted trees have a smaller collision size and block less vision than regular trees.
Unlike with other planted trees,  Tango does not heal for twice as long when targeting an Acorn Shot tree.
The planted tree provides 200 radius ground vision around itself, which lasts for 20 seconds or until the tree is destroyed.
When put on Alt-cast, the ability can only be ground-targeted.
When unit-targeted, the initial hit is not counted towards the bounce limit, so that up to 3/4/5/6 ( 5/6/7/8) hits can be achieved.
The initial projectile travels at a speed of 2200.
The speed while bouncing can be defined as expr AttackProjectileSpeed × 0.5.
This affects Acorn Shot not being able to be reflected on certain  melee heroes (e.g.  Marci) because they have 0 projectile speed.
With Hoodwink's default attack projectile speed, the bouncing projectile travels at a speed of 900.
The projectile speed can be further increased by other attack projectile speed bonuses.
The projectile bounces in 0.1-second intervals.
Can bounce on the same unit multiple times, but only when another target was hit between the bounces.
Can bounce on units in the Fog of War.
Can bounce on attack immune units.
Cannot bounce on invisible, invulnerable or hidden units.
Upon projectile hit, Acorn Shot causes Hoodwink to perform an instant attack on the enemies.
These instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. They do not have True Strike, but completely ignore disarms.
For  melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss.
Acorn Shot's instant attack first applies the self-total outgoing attack damage multiplier, then grants unique flat bonus attack damage upon the projectile hit.
The total attack damage includes all already existing attack damage changes, including conditional bonus sources (e.g. Bash and Quell).
This can be defined as expr ΣAtk × 75% + 55/90/125/160
Applies the bonus attack damage only to the Acorn Shot projectile.
Therefore, attack damage based attack modifiers (e.g. critical strike and lifesteal) include the 75% bonus damage as well.
Since the damage comes from a regular attack, it counts as attack damage and not as spell damage.
It is affected by damage block, but unaffected by spell damage amplification and cannot spell lifesteal.
When ground-targeted, the instant attack of Acorn Shot does not break the invisibility of the following sources:  Decoy,  Disguise and  Glimmer.
For  Fade, the invisibility breaks upon projectile hit after the fade time.
For  Shadow Walk and  Shadow Walk, the invisibility breaks upon projectile hit and applies its ability effects.
The projectile performs the instant attack, then applies the debuff.
The movement speed slow is independent of the instant attack, and is applied even when the instant attack misses.
The projectile provides 200 radius flying vision around itself as it travels. This vision does not last.
Fully ignores  Couriers.

Tosses a net trap that stuns enemy heroes if they are near a tree in the area. Affected enemies take damage and are pulled towards the tree nearest to them, and have their vision reduced to 0 for the duration of the stun.

modifier_hoodwink_bushwhack_trapStrongHoodwink favors Ironwood groves for ambushes, but the wary step carefully in all areas of the mistwoods.


The projectile travels at a speed of 1300.
Trees within the radius indicator are highlighted when a target location is selected.
With the max cast range and radius, Bushwhack can hit units up to 1265 range away.
Provides 265 ( 400) radius flying vision at the target location upon reaching it, lasting for 1.4/1.6/1.8/2 seconds.
If there are no trees within the area, the ability only provides flying vision upon reaching the target.
Deals 19.29/33.75/45/54 damage in 0.3-second intervals, starting 0.3 seconds after receiving the debuff, resulting in 4/5/6/6 instances.
Hit enemies are stunned and moved towards the tree closest to the center of the targeted point.
However, if there is another tree in the way, the unit is bound to that tree instead.
Units affected are moved toward the tree at a speed of 1000, then upward with a height of 75.
Exposes hit enemies for the debuff duration, revealing their exact location.
Bound units can be freed in the following conditions:
Destroying the tree they are bound to.
When affected by any other forced movement sources.
If Bushwhack binds a unit to a planted tree with an expiration timer, that planted tree cannot expire until Bushwhack ends.
During the stun duration, the bound units have their total vision range set to 0.
Therefore,  Moon Shard's  nighttime vision bonus is reduced as well.
Affects units inside the Fog of War, but not invisible units.
Fully affect untargetable units from  Shadows and  Shadow Realm.
Does not affect  Roshan, but interrupts his attack orders.
While  Scurry is active, Bushwhack has a cast range of 1050/1100/1150/1200. Scurry Link▶️Link▶️ER

Hoodwink turns invisible, increasing her movement speed, and creates a decoy illusion that starts aiming a decreased damage Sharpshooter at the nearest enemy hero. If the illusion is attacked or hit by a targeted ability, it is destroyed and it throws a lesser bushwhack towards the enemy.

modifier_hoodwink_bushwhack_trapStrongAbility Draft Notes:
Does not require  Bushwhack to be drafted for it to get applied.
Requires drafting  Sharpshooter to be unlocked.


     Manta Style illusion as they appear to allies.  
Requires  Aghanim's Scepter to be unlocked.
Interrupt Hoodwink's channeling abilities upon cast.
Does not require  Sharpshooter to be leveled to be unlocked, once Aghanim's Scepter is acquired.
However, it relies on Sharpshooter to work, since it directly uses its values. This means when Sharpshooter is not learned, Decoy creates an illusion that runs towards the nearest enemy hero or enemy illusion.
Although the Decoy illusion consumes mana to use Sharpshooter, Sharpshooter will still be cast even if it does not have enough mana.
Sharpshooter notes fully apply.
Upon cast, Decoy creates an uncontrollable and indistinguishable illusion at Hoodwink's current facing direction that automatically channels Sharpshooter, and homes into the nearest enemy hero.
Since Sharpshooter is cast by the illusion, it procs all on-cast effects like a regular ability.
The illusion created has the  Scurry's modifier, it is completely independent of the ability and does not require Scurry to be learned.
The Sharpshooter channeled by the illusion cannot be manually canceled in any way.
It neither has a gold, nor experience bounty.
The invisibility buff has an instant fade time and is lost upon reaching the cast point of abilities or items, or upon landing an attack. Missed attacks do break it.
The illusion is phased and has unobstructed movement.
When hit by an attack or a unit-targeted ability within 1000 range, the channeled Sharpshooter is canceled, and Decoy's effects trigger.
Sharpshooter will not be fired this way.
This means enemy attacks missed (including attacks evaded by the illusion's Scurry evasion) do not trigger the Decoy.
Only triggers on attacks of enemy heroes, illusions, clones, and creep-heroes.
Triggers on abilities of any unit, not just heroes, following the rules of Spell Block. The triggering ability is blocked as well.
Triggers even when affected by an allied  Transfer Spellblock.
Attacks and abilities coming from more than 1000 range away do not trigger the Decoy.
However, abilities cast beyond that distance are still fully blocked. Attacks affect the Decoy normally.
When triggered, the illusion gets destroyed, and a lesser  Bushwhack is sent towards the target's location.
Upon reaching the location, it first creates a planted tree. This tree is smaller than the other trees on the map and has a smaller collision size.
 Tango heals for twice as long when targeting a Decoy tree.
Although using Bushwhack's modifier, the area stun is completely independent of the ability and does not require Bushwhack to be learned.
Other Bushwhack notes fully apply.
Can only hit heroes, clones and creeps, but not illusions and creep-heroes.
Can deal up to 330/540/750 ( 405/615/825) and 165/270/375 ( 202.5/307.5/412.5) damage to heroes and creeps respectively (before reductions).
The projectile does not hit invulnerable or hidden units, it flies right through them.
SPELL STEAL  Rubick has to acquire  Sharpshooter in order for Decoy illusion to channel Sharpshooter, else the illusion runs toward the nearest enemy target. Hunter's Boomerang   Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️FB

Tosses a boomerang in an arc. Upon contact, it returns to Hoodwink. The boomerang will deal damage as it passes through or hits enemies, and apply a Hunter's Mark that causes affected enemies to be slowed and be more vulnerable to spell damage.

modifier_hoodwink_hunters_markAnyAbility Draft Notes:
Requires drafting  Sharpshooter to be unlocked.



Requires  Aghanim's Shard to be unlocked.
When unit-targeted, the boomerang homes in on the target.
Can be cast on any unit, including allies, excluding self, buildings, and wards.
Targeting allies send the boomerang toward them but does not affect them.
The boomerang either travels at a speed of 900 or reaches the target unit between 0.5 – 1.2 seconds, whichever is faster. The same applies upon returning.
This means the boomerang can fly for 1 – 2.4 seconds at minimum and maximum respectively.
The duration is set once upon cast, based on the distances. If the distances change after cast, the speed adapts to the predetermined duration.
For example, if the target was within 450 range upon cast, the boomerang will have fully returned within 1 second.
If the target was more than 1080 range away, it will have fully returned within 2.4 seconds.
When ground-targeted, it flies towards that point at the fixed speed of 900.
The boomerang is always thrown from Hoodwink's right side and returns from the opposite side.
It flies towards the target arcing to the right side and returns to Hoodwink in a mirrored arc.
Both arcs have a combined width of 400.
Its minimum travel distance is 400 as well, so when targeting a point closer than 400 range, it flies in a triangular pattern with side lengths of 400.
The boomerang first applies the debuff, then the damage.
The boomerang provides 150 radius flying vision around itself as it travels. This vision lasts for 2 seconds.
The primary target is damaged and debuffed when getting within its radius like any other unit.
However, the boomerang only starts returning once fully reaches the target.
Applies generic incoming damage amplification on affected enemy units. Stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation.
Affects only spell damage the affected targets receive. Does not amplify the following damage sources:
Attack damage.
Damage flagged as HP removal.
Despite utilizing incoming damage amplification, it does not affect the damage sources that ignore outgoing amplification (e.g. Cleave sources,  Damage Return and  Moon Glaives).

modifier_hoodwink_sharpshooter_debuffAnyWhile her first arbalest was a chance discovery, Hoodwink now takes great care in carving and caring for her own -- of course with some necessary components pilfered or otherwise cleverly procured.

     Sharpshooter's indicator.  
For better readability, the turn rate during the wind-up time is given as degrees per second, instead of radians per 0.03 seconds.
60° per second equal a turn rate of 0.031.
A timer above Hoodwink's head shows how much time is left before the bolt releases. This timer is visible to everyone.
The direction can be changed with a move order ( Right Click or M).
A line indicator is cast in front of Hoodwink while aiming the shot, showing the path it will take once released.
The indicator also shows for how long it is being winded up, starting out green, and slowly turning red over 5 seconds.
The indicator is visible to the player only. Neither allies nor enemies can see it.
Hoodwink can still perform other actions during Sharpshooter. Non-targeted abilities and items are used normally.
However, targeted items that require facing can only be cast when targeted within her current facing direction.
Targeting outside her facing direction causes her to get locked in position until the Stop (S) or Hold (H) command is used.
Hoodwink cannot move and is disarmed during Sharpshooter.
However, she can be moved by forced movement sources, but not fear.
Attack orders behave like move orders during disarms, and it sets a new location as well.
Sharpshooter cannot be interrupted by disables, and can only be canceled by the following conditions:
Casting the  End Sharpshooter sub-ability or by Hoodwink's death.
Casting  Town Portal Scroll.
However, silencing Hoodwink prevents her from manually firing Sharpshooter earlier with the sub-ability.
Once released, Hoodwink gets knocked back in an arc with a height of 75 and distance of up to 350 over up to 5 seconds, or until touching the ground again.
This means the knockback distance and duration can be reduced/increased by jumping up/down a ramp or impassable terrain.
The damage and debuff duration values starts at 20% max power and increases for each 0.1 seconds wound up, reaching max potency in 3 seconds.
The damage increases by 14.67/24/33.33 ( 19.56/32/44.44) per wind-up interval.
TALENT Since both the  minimum and maximum value of the damage are increased evenly by 125, the above damage increment values remain the same.
The debuff duration increases by 0.13 ( 0.18) seconds per wind-up interval.
The debuff applies Break on the target, disabling their passive abilities.
The bolt starts on Hoodwink's position, and travels at a speed of 2200 ( 2750) for the full distance, or until hitting a valid target.
With the travel distance and collision radius, the projectile can hit units up to 3125 range away. It does not search for units behind the starting location.
Can only hit heroes, clones and creeps, but not illusions and creep-heroes.
Can deal up to 275/450/625 ( 337.5/512.5/687.5) damage to creeps (before reductions).
The projectile does not hit invulnerable or hidden units, it flies right through them.
The bolt first applies the debuff, then the damage.
The bolt provides 350 radius flying vision as it travels. This vision does not linger.
Has a min and max cast backswing of 4.5 ‒ 9.5 seconds.
The cast backswing starts upon cast, so the effective backswing depends on when the shot was released.

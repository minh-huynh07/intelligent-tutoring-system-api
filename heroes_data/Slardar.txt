previous puddles are more than 50 range away from the target's current location. if there is a previous puddle within range, it gets its duration refreshed instead. this means, despite the description, it does not create a continuous trail and has gaps between the puddles depending on the target's speed. each created puddle has its own independent duration. armor reduction of successive

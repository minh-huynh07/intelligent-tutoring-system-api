[?] power cogs has an aura at its center with a radius of 225 that debuffs enemy heroes and buff ally heroes. by default, the debuff does nothing but create particle effects on enemies within. treats illusions, clones, and creep-heroes as heroes. the aura always lasts the full duration and lingers for 0.5 seconds, even if all cogs get destroyed. the aura grants a magical damage barrier on the affected targets that absorbs magical damage values, causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity. stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources. has a higher priority than universal damage barriers in the group of damage barriers. however, when combined with other damage-negating sources (e.g. refraction), power cogs does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire. talent with the debuff immunity granting talent, the same aura now grants clockwerk debuff immunity with dispel within the radius. the aura first applies the basic dispel, then grants debuff immunity. the aura effects are also reapplied upon reentry. stacks multiplicatively with other magic resistance sources. increases clockwerk's magic resistance to 62.5%. with the magic resistance bonus from this source, every 10 points of intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 0.5%.

traveling, and 600 radius flying vision that lingers for 6 seconds at the targeted area after reaching it. talent the rocket flare true sight talent grants true sight at the targeted area for 10

provided by an aura which affects enemies. its debuff lingers for 0.5 seconds. does not reveal enchanted trees. the projectile can be seen on the minimap. it appears green to allies and red to enemies. enemies require vision over the area to see it. the projectile blocks neutral creeps camps. scepter while overclocking, rocket flare fires a total of 3 rockets, launched in 0.15-second intervals of each other horizontally upon cast. the rockets are launched in the following sequence: target area 125 to the right area 125 to the left area. overclocking also sets the cooldown to 3 while active. does not reset the ability's cooldown if cast before overclocking is active. the cooldown reducing talent is not applied to the overclocking rocket flare cooldown. shard while jetpack is

aghanim's shard to be unlocked. upon cast, the following ability effects are applied on clockwerk while the ability is active: clockwerk is disarmed and ascends 260 units above the z-axis. does not need to turn to cast abilities or items within its cast range, this is not limited to only clockwerk's abilities. clockwerk is not disabled while jetpack is active. for better readability, the turn rate during the flight is given as degrees per second, instead of radians per 0.033 seconds. 75 ( 150 ) per second equal a turn rate of 0.044 ( 0.087). clockwerk turns for a maximum of 1 second per issued move order. this means a single move order does not cause him to fly in a circle around the targeted point. clockwerk's final path and direction pre-move order depends on a vector from his position to the targeted point, which is always parallel with the path. casting hookshot dispels jetpack if it latches on a target and starts pulling. does not end it if it misses. the flight speed equals clockwerk's current movement speed. spell steal rubick ascends 150 units above the z-axis instead and does not turn into a flying unit. hookshot link link rt abilitytarget point affectsself /

aghanim's shard upgrade:new ability grants the jetpack ability. modifiers [?]modifier_rattletrap_hookshotdeath modifier_stunnedstronga somewhat unwieldy device, the hookshot sends the otherwise clunky clockwerk armor flying through the air. the hook travels at a speed of 4000/5000/6000, taking a maximum of 0.5 seconds to reach max length. the effective area for the hook travel distance is half of a sphere and not a flat circle. therefore, the hook may latch onto units on the z-axis as well. provides 125 radius ground vision while the hook is traveling, and 300 radius ground vision while the hook latches or reaches its maximum travel distance. both vision radius does not linger. as soon as the hook latches on a unit, clockwerk is pulled towards the unit at the same speed as the hook itself. clockwerk gets pulled towards the latched unit's current location, and not towards the original location where the hook latched on it. this means when the target moves or gets moved, clockwerk's trajectory adapts immediately. clockwerk is silenced and disarmed during the pull. however, item abilities can be used. the pulling lasts a maximum of 0.5 seconds, so if the target moves too far away, clockwerk may not fully reach it. the pull gets canceled when clockwerk gets affected by other forced movement sources. the area damage and stun around clockwerk always happens, regardless of whether the hook latched on an ally or enemy. when latching on an ally, the ally is not disabled and can act freely. it is not interrupted either. when latching on an enemy, it gets stunned for 1.2/1.4/1.6 seconds, or until clockwerk reaches it. this means if clockwerk does not reach it, it is stunned for the full duration. this can happen when either the pull gets canceled, or when the target gets moved too far away during the pull. the latched enemy is also hit by the stun and area damage. this means the latched target is stunned up to 1.7/1.9/2.1 ( 2.3/2.6/2.9) seconds longer than secondary targets, due to the initial latch stun. hookshot first applies the debuff, then the damage. fully ignores couriers, wards, buildings and hidden units. can latch on invulnerable or invisible units. scepter while overclocking, hookshot's stun and damage radius is increased to 262.5. shard while jetpack is active, hookshot can be cast without facing the targeted area.

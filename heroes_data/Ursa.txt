For a behemoth of his size, Ursa is deceptively nimble.


A charge is consumed whenever an attack is executed. Therefore, missed attacks use up charges as well.
The number of remaining charges is visible on the buff icon. The buff and the visual effects of the ability are visible to everyone.
Stacks multiplicatively with other slow resistance sources.
Successive casts do not stack but refresh the whole amount of charges and the buff duration instead. Fury Swipes  EW

modifier_ursa_fury_swipes_damage_increaseDeathIn nature, the wounded rarely survive the attacks of hungry predators.


Fury Swipe's damage is considered as a conditional attack damage bonus.
Although the attack damage bonus values are not displayed in the HUD, it is still considered and directly added to Ursa's attack damage.
The attack damage bonus values are not considered by critical strike.
However, it is considered by lifesteal and cleave, and it can be reduced only by flat reductions (e.g. damage block).
Since it is considered bonus attack damage, it is not affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions.
On each attack Fury Swipes first adds 1 stack and then deals damage based on the stack count.
This means that the bonus attack damage is applied even with the first attack.
Each successful attack refreshes the duration, ability and  talent upgrade values of the whole stack. Missed attacks neither place the buff, nor add a stack or refresh it.
The number of Fury Swipe stacks is visible on the debuff icon placed on affected units.
For how much damage Fury Swipe deals on each level, and the total damage it accumulates over a certain amount of attacks, please refer to the chart below.
Does not work against buildings, wards and allied units.
TALENT The stack duration increasing  talent does not increase the debuff duration against  Roshan. Enrage Link▶️RR

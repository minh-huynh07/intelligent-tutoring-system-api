Aghanim's Shard Upgrade:

Puck's attacks deal bonus magic damage. Puck attacks all enemies within its attack range (550) every time it phase shifts.

Modifiers [?]modifier_puck_phase_shiftDeath
With a quip and flash, Puck returns to the alien dimension from whence it came.


Disjoints projectiles upon cast.
Certain items abilities which do not cancel channeling (e.g.  Shadow Walk or  Arctic Blast) do cancel Phase Shift.
Puck is invulnerable and hidden for its duration.
Does not provide phased movement, so the caster can still block other units during Phase Shift.
The buff lingers for one server tick once the channeling ends or is interrupted, which allows using items while still invulnerable and hidden.
SHARD Phase Shift now causes Puck to perform instant attacks on all enemies within range whenever Phase Shift is cast.
These instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. They do not have True Strike, but completely ignore disarms.
Every visible and attackable enemy nearby, including buildings and  Couriers, are attacked.
Does not attack wards and  Undying Zombies.
For  melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss.
The search radius can be further increased by other attack range bonuses.
SHARD Grants flat magical attack damage bonus.
The magical attack damage bonus component only works with spell lifesteal and spell damage amplification.
SPELL STEAL Does not interrupt the channeling upon losing ability. Ethereal Jaunt  Link▶️DE

Replaces  Illusory Orb while the orb flies, instead of being in a separate slot.



This sub-ability is inactive until Illusory Orb is cast, and turns inactive again once the  Illusory Orb of that cast is gone.
Ethereal Jaunt disjoints projectiles upon cast.
When two Illusory Orbs are cast in succession, this ability only stays active for the duration of the first cast.
However, it always teleports the caster to their last created Illusory Orb. Dream Coil  Link▶️Link▶️RC

Creates a coil of volatile magic that latches onto enemy Heroes, damaging and leashing them. If the enemy hero stretches the coil by moving too far away, it snaps, stunning and dealing additional damage.

modifier_puck_coiledDeath
modifier_puck_coiled_break_stunStrongThe Faerie Dragon sows confusion by forcing its enemies to vividly dream about their own mortality.


Every enemy hero within 375 range of the coil gets leashed upon cast, preventing them from casting certain mobility abilities.
The coil does not leash enemies after cast. Therefore, entering the area after the cast has no effect on enemies.
Treat illusions, clones and creep-heroes as heroes.
The coil duration is not affected by status resistance sources.
If a leashed enemy moves 600 range away from the coil, the leash snaps, stunning and damaging the enemy.
It does not matter how far or how fast the enemy moves away, the stun and damage always hit it if possible.
The leash snap first applies the damage, then the debuff.
Dream Coil leashes invisible units and on units in the Fog of War as well, but it does not provide vision over them. The link visually draws to their last known location.
Multiple instances of Dream Coil fully stack, with each cast applying its own separate leash.
SCEPTER Dream Coil now perform instant attacks on all leashed enemies and enemies stunned from breaking the leash. Although the instant attacks originate from the center of the Dream Coil, they are still sourced to Puck.
These instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally (e.g. magical attack damage bonus of   Phase Shift). They do not have True Strike, but completely ignore disarms.
Does not require Puck to be within the coil radius to perform the instant attacks.
As long as enemies is leashed or stunned, the center of the Dream Coil will attack regardless of the distance between enemies and the center.
Dream Coil will only attack enemies leashed or stunned by itself. Enemies leashed or stunned by other Dream Coil will be ignored.
The coil attack interval can be defined as expr (100 × 1.7) / (ΣAS × 1)
With the attack speed limits, the min and max possible coil attack intervals are 0.243 ‒ 8.5 seconds plus a server tick per instant attack respectively.
The interval is not set upon cast. On each instant attack, the interval updates based on Puck's current attack rate.

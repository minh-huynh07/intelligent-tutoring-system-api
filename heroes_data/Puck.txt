illusory orb link link qr abilitytarget point affectsenemies damagephysical puck launches a magic orb that floats in a straight path, damaging enemy units along the way. at any point, puck may teleport to the orb's location using ethereal jaunt. cast animation: 0.1+0.27cast range: 3000travel distance: 1950damage radius: 225damage: 75/150/225/300 ( 125/200/275/350)flying vision radius: 450 11/10/9/8 100/110/120/130modifiers [?]modifier_projectile_visionundispellable the playful faerie dragon delights in confusing others, vanishing and reappearing where unexpected. illusory orb travels at a speed of 550, taking 3.55 seconds to reach max distance with the travel distance and damage radius, the orb can hit units up to 2175 range away. the orb starts emitting red pulses after having traveled for 2.5 seconds, indicating that it is about to reach its maximum travel range. leveling the ability immediately updates the damage values of the current instance. talent however, the damage increasing talent does not update the current instance. the orb leaves behind a trail of flying vision, with a radius of 450. the vision lingers for 5 seconds. waning rift link ww abilitytarget area

teleport the caster when cast while rooted.modifiers [?] modifier_silenceanywith a mischievous grin, puck spreads its enchanted powder which disrupts magical flow. double-tapping automatically targets 25 range in front of puck. waning rift does not disjoint projectiles upon cast. despite the visual effects, the silence and damage are applied instantly in the entire radius. waning rift first applies the damage, then the silence debuff. phase shift link ef abilityno target / channeled( passive) affectsself ( enemies) damage instant attack puck briefly shifts into another dimension where it is immune from harm. passive component magical attack damage bonus: 35cast animation: 0,01+0max channel time: 1/1.75/2.5/3.25buff linger duration: 0.03 instant attack radius: 550 8/7.5/7/6.5 0 aghanim's shard upgrade: puck's attacks deal bonus magic damage. puck attacks all enemies within its attack range (550) every time it phase shifts. modifiers [?]modifier_puck_phase_shiftdeath with a quip and flash, puck returns to the alien dimension from whence it came. disjoints projectiles upon cast. certain items abilities which do not cancel channeling (e.g. shadow walk or arctic blast) do cancel phase shift. puck is invulnerable and hidden for its duration. does not provide phased movement, so the caster can still block other units during phase shift. the buff lingers for one server tick once the channeling ends or is interrupted, which allows using items while still invulnerable and hidden. shard phase shift now causes puck to perform instant attacks on all enemies within range whenever phase shift is cast. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. they do not have true strike, but completely ignore disarms. every visible and attackable enemy nearby, including buildings and couriers, are attacked. does not attack wards and undying zombies. for melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss. the search radius can be further increased by other attack range bonuses. shard grants flat magical attack damage bonus. the magical attack damage bonus component only works with spell lifesteal and spell damage amplification. spell steal does not interrupt the channeling upon losing ability. ethereal jaunt link de abilityno target affectsself teleports puck to a flying illusory orb. cast animation: 0+0.53 0 0ability draft notes: replaces illusory orb while the orb flies, instead of being in a separate slot. this sub-ability is inactive until illusory orb is cast, and turns inactive again once the illusory orb of that cast is gone. ethereal jaunt disjoints projectiles upon cast. when two illusory orbs are cast in succession, this ability only stays active for the duration of the first cast. however, it always teleports the caster to their last created illusory orb. dream coil link link rc abilitytarget area ( passive) affectsenemy heroes damagephysical ( instant attack) creates a coil of volatile magic that latches onto enemy heroes, damaging and leashing them. if the enemy hero stretches the coil by moving too far away, it snaps, stunning and dealing additional damage. passive component coil attack rate divisor: 1cast animation: 0.1+0.27cast range: 750coil latch radius: 375link break radius: 600initial damage: 150/230/310 ( 325/405/485)link break

attack rate. the attacks continue while the target is stunned if they break the dream coil. debuff immunity notes:does not pierce debuff immunity.fully pierces debuff immunity.modifiers [?]modifier_dream_coil_thinkerundispellable modifier_puck_coileddeath modifier_puck_coiled_break_stunstrongthe faerie dragon sows confusion by forcing its enemies to vividly dream about their own mortality. every enemy hero within 375 range of the coil gets leashed upon cast, preventing them from casting certain mobility abilities. the coil does not leash enemies after cast. therefore, entering the area after the cast has no effect on enemies. treat illusions, clones and creep-heroes as heroes. the coil duration is not affected by status resistance sources. if a leashed enemy moves 600 range away from the coil, the leash snaps, stunning and damaging the enemy. it does not matter how far or how fast the enemy moves away, the stun and damage always hit it if possible. the leash snap first applies the damage, then the debuff. dream coil leashes invisible units and on units in the fog of war as well, but it does not provide vision over them. the link visually draws to their last known location. multiple instances of dream coil fully stack, with each cast applying its own separate leash. scepter dream coil now perform instant attacks on all leashed enemies and enemies stunned from breaking the leash. although the instant attacks originate from the center of the dream coil, they are still sourced to puck. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally (e.g. magical attack damage bonus of phase shift). they do not have true strike, but completely ignore disarms. does not require puck to be within the coil radius to perform the instant attacks. as long as enemies is leashed or stunned, the center of the dream coil will attack regardless of the distance between enemies and the center. dream coil will only attack enemies leashed or stunned by itself. enemies leashed or stunned by other dream coil will be ignored. the coil attack interval can be defined as expr (100 1.7) / ( as 1) with the attack speed limits, the min and max possible coil attack intervals are 0.243 8.5 seconds plus a server tick per instant attack respectively. the interval is not set upon cast. on each instant attack, the interval updates based on puck's current attack rate.

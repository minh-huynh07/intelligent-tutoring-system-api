Tresdin knows that an enemy's most vulnerable moment often follows their fiercest stroke.


Only procs when a unit starts an attack against Legion Commander, regardless of distance.
This means canceled and/or missed attacks from units can proc it as well.
Can proc on attacks from any unit, regardless of faction or unit type, including wards and buildings.
Upon proccing, Legion Commander receives a buff, which grants 1000 attack speed and lifesteal bonus.
This buff lasts for 1 second, or until she lands an attack, whichever is shorter. Missed attacks do not count.
If the ability procs while already attacking, Legion Commander performs an instant attack on the current attack target instead.
The instant attack can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. They do not have True Strike.
This instant attack does not interfere with the ongoing attack and does not have any attack animation.
This means the instant attack also uses up the attack speed and lifesteal bonus immediately.
If the ability procs during Legion commander's attack point animation, Legion Commander performs an instant attack, ending the attack point animation and immediately starting the attack backswing animation.
If the ability procs during Legion Commander's attack backswing animation, Legion Commander performs an instant attack, but it does not end the backswing animation.
Stacks additively with other lifesteal sources.
Cannot lifesteal off of wards, buildings, and ally units.

modifier_legion_commander_duelDeathTo face a soldier of Stonehall in single combat is a challenge few can resist.


Provides True Sight for both factions, over both Legion Commander and the affected target for its duration.
It also silences and mutes both duelists, grants them unobstructed pathing, and taunts them against each other.
Duel has the highest priority in the group of taunt sources. This means when combined with other taunt sources (e.g.  Winter's Curse), other taunts cannot make dueling units change their attacking targets.
Both affected duelists can be affected, but cannot be moved by forced movement and fear sources. When affected by fear, the duelist simply does not attack.
While Dueling,  Overwhelming Odds has an  instant cast point and does not require facing the target to cast.
Only Overwhelming Odds can be cast, regardless of faction and of disables affecting either duelists.
Other abilities are still silenced and the items are still muted for both duelists.
The Duel is nulled in the following conditions:
When the distance between the duelists exceeds 2000 at any point during its duration, resulting in no victor.
When either duelist is being affected by True Sight immunity sources (e.g.  Depth Shroud).
When either duelist is brought into   Supernova or swallowed by   Dismember.
Duel ends when the duration of a reflected  Omnislash or  Swiftslash ends.
When Legion Commander shatters from  Ice Blast's kill health threshold.
When either duelist dies while carrying the  Aegis of the Immortal.
When both duelists survive the duel.
When any Duel is nulled, all other Duels involving the duelists are also nulled immediately.
The following conditions also do not grant the winner attack damage bonus to Legion Commander:
If the affected target is an illusion, a creep-hero, or the  Tempest Double.
When  Meepo or its  Meepo Clones is instantly killed due to either the Prime or any one of its clones dying, including being denied, during the Duel duration.
Grants the winner a stack of flat bonus attack damage and considers the duelist a winner in the following conditions:
If the dying hero is affected by a Reincarnation source (excluding  Aegis of the Immortal).
If the dying hero if affected by  Wraith Delay and is killed by the opponent instead of the opponent's teammates. If the opponent's teammates land the killing blow on the dying hero under  Wraith Delay, the duel will last until its duration ends, or the opponent dies (in this case, the dying hero gets duel damage).
The opponent dies before the duration ends.
The opponent is killed or denied by any unit, including neutral creeps and death by self-damage. The winner does not need to be credited for the kill.
For clones, the  Tempest Double loses the granted bonus when it dies or expires, while the bonus is granted permanently to the dueled  Meepo Clone.
For illusions, the granted stack lasts until the illusion expires.
The number of bonus attack damage gained can be seen on the status buff icon and can be seen in its description.
If Legion Commander is victorious based on the aforementioned conditions, a unit-targeted  Press the Attack based on its current level is passively applied to her.
If it is not leveled, or if the caster does not have Press the Attack, it is not applied. Press the Attack notes fully apply.
Press the Attack applied this way is independent of the ability and does not cost any mana.
Multiple instances of Duel on the same target work independently of each other, with each instance having its own duration.
SCEPTER Duel now applies generic incoming damage reduction to both Legion Commander and the affected target. Stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation.
Affects all damage types they both take from any sources, except each other.
Does not reduce damage flagged as HP Removal.

SOULBIND Attacks the primary taunted target first. When the primary target is killed, then the secondary target. Duels the creep-hero if it is the secondary target, but neither can be the winner. If Legion Commander dies, both affected targets will receive bonus damage.

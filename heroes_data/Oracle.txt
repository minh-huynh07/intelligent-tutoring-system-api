Gathers Oracle's power into a bolt of scouring energy that, when released, damages, roots, and purges enemies of buffs in an area around the target. If target is an ally it will only purge debuffs. Can be channeled for up to 2.5 seconds. The root duration is equal to the time spent channeling.

modifier_oracle_fortunes_end_purgeAnyThe astral orb crackles with power while raw energy lances out, temporarily disrupting an enemy's connection to their own body.


The projectile travels at a speed of 1200.
Applies all of the abilities' effects to enemies within the effect radius regardless if the targeted unit is an ally or an enemy.
Enemies within the effect radius are always dispelled, while the allies can only be dispelled when unit-targeted. Therefore, only one ally can be dispelled per cast.
The buff/debuff of  Fate's Edict is always dispelled by Fortune's End.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
Fortune's End first applies the basic dispel, the debuff, then the damage.
Can directly be cast on invulnerable units, fully affecting them, though the damage gets negated by the invulnerability. Does not affect hidden targets.
When the projectile connects with either an invulnerable or hidden unit, it still affects other units within the radius, but not the primary target.
Can be cast on and fully affects ally  Couriers, but not enemy Couriers.
Can neither target, nor affect wards and buildings.
Applies a visual effect on the targeted unit upon cast, indicating that it is directly targeted. This visual effect is visible to everyone.
The sound during the channeling is audible to everyone as well.
The channeling is not canceled regardless of the target's current status effects (e.g. turning invisible, invulnerable etc.).
However, when the channeling is interrupted through disabling Oracle, the projectile is released prematurely.
Only the root duration is based on the max channel time.
The duration starts at 0.75 ( 1.25) and increases by 0.08 per 0.1-second channeled, reaching 2.75 ( 3.25) in 2.5 seconds.
TALENT The instant Fortune's End  talent removes the need for channeling and causes the projectile to be released instantly on max power.
Has a cast backswing of 0.3 upon learning the  talent.
Selecting the  talent while already channeling Fortune's End visually removes the channeling bar, but does not interfere with the cast in any way.
Fortune's End roots affected targets, preventing them from moving and casting certain mobility abilities.
Provides True Sight over the targets. Fate's Edict  Link▶️WF

Oracle enraptures a target, disarming them and granting them 100% magic damage resistance. Can be cast on allies and enemies.

Set the ally target's magic resistance to 100%, but does not disarm them.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
Cannot be cast on allies who have ☐ Disabled Help from Oracle.
Disarms the affected enemy target, but does not set their magic resistance.
Fate's Edict always places a debuff on the target, regardless of the target's faction.
This means if cast on self or an ally, allies can dispel it, while enemies cannot.
 Fortune's End can always dispel the modifier, regardless of the target's faction.
Since it applies a debuff on allies, any dispel (e.g.  False Promise or  Echo Shell) will dispel it from allies.
Vice versa, if cast on enemies, enemies can dispel it, while allies cannot. Purifying Flames  Link▶️EE

Like a hall of mirrors might amplify the light of a single candle, the shattered walls of the universe can transform the light of prophecy into a burning torch.


The damage is applied instantly upon cast, followed by the healing over time.
The damage is lethal to enemies, but not to allies, so it cannot be used for denying.
Cannot be cast on allies who have ☐ Disabled Help from Oracle.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
Successive casts on the same target fully stack, with each cast having its own intervals and instances.
Heals in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after cast, resulting in 9 instances of heal.
Can heal up to 135/225/315/405 health per cast.
Effectively heals up to 45/45/45/45 health when considering the initial damage.
TALENT With the enemy damage increasing  talent, it effectively deals up to -18/9/36/63 damage when considering the initial damage (before reductions).
SCEPTER With  Rain of Destiny, Purifying Flames itself can heal up to 162/270/378/486 health within the area for the full duration, without considering the initial damage. Rain of Destiny Link▶️DD

This ability is not available in Ability Draft.
Through mixture of the astral and the atmospheric, Nerif bends a single reality into paradoxical alignment.


Requires  Aghanim's Shard to be unlocked.
Deals damage and heals in 1-second intervals, starting immediately upon cast, resulting in up to 11 instances.
Can deal up to 440 damage to a single unit (before reductions).
Since it starts immediately upon cast, the first heal instance is not affected by the heal amplification.
With its own heal amplification, it can heal up to 520 health, considering the first instance not being amplified.
Grants 20% heal amplification for both incoming and outgoing healing done by Oracle within the radius.
Stacks diminishingly with other heal amplification sources.
Does not grant other restoration manipulations.
The heal manipulation is provided by an aura and lingers for 0.5 seconds.
Both the heal and damage per second component are independent of the aura.
The damage and heal per second of multiple instances fully stack.
However, the heal manipulation does not.
Places the modifier on  Couriers, but does not heal or damage them. False Promise Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️RR

Temporarily alters an ally's destiny, delaying any healing or damage taken until False Promise ends. Any healing that is delayed by False Promise is doubled. Removes most negative status effects and disables on initial cast.

Foes and false prophets oft make lies of men's fates.


Applies a strong dispel on the target upon cast.
Can be cast on illusions and creep-heroes.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
False Promise fully negates damage (after most reductions), causing several on-damage effects to not trigger.
Instant killing effects (e.g.  Culling Blade) are not prevented, and the following effects are also not negated:
Max health bonuses of  strength gained from any sources.
Setting health sources.
While active, False Promise registers every damage instance (after reductions) the target would receive and keeps them in order.
All healing instance received is summed up and doubled (before other amplifications and reductions).
For False Promise, only healing sources and health regeneration values are considered as on-heal effects.
At the end of the duration, False Promise checks to see if the sum of damage received is greater than the sum of healing received. Then, the heal sum gets subtracted from each individual damage instance in order.
This is repeated until either all damage instances are negated by the heal, or until the summed heal value depletes.
If the heal sum depletes, then the remaining damage instances get applied in order.
If the target dies, the kill is credited to whoever's instance that dealt the killing blow. In case the damage is from an ally, then the target is denied.
If all damage instances are negated, the remaining heal value is applied as a single heal to the target.
For a more detailed example explaining these interactions, please refer to the example below.
While active, the following abilities grants the following amount of healing received:
Each  Purifying Flames heal per second instances provide 30/50/70/90 healing recieved instances.
SCEPTER  Rain of Destiny can provide up to 752/896/1040 ( 896/1040/1040) healing received within the radius.
Further increases Purifying Flames heal per second to 36/60/84/108 healing received instances within the radius.
The remaining damage applied at the end of the duration has the HP Removal flag, and the No-multiplier flag, preventing its damage from being affected by any generic damage manipulation.
Non-lethal damage instances delayed during False Promise remain non-lethal when re-applied at the end of the duration.
Certain damage negation sources (e.g.  Gravekeeper's Cloak or  Mischief) may reduce or avoid the damage applied at the end of the duration.
If the target is invulnerable as False Promise expires, the effects are applied as soon as the target is vulnerable.
Successive casts on the same target do not stack but refresh the duration. Both the damage and heal value counters are not reset.
SCEPTER False Promise also grants the target invisibility buff with a 0.15-second fade delay.
As long as the buff is present, the target will keep turning invisible.
During the fade delay, the target can still cast abilities, use items and perform attacks.
SCEPTER Invisibility sources with fade delays use the same modifier and do not stack with other invisibility sources of the same type — the longer duration overrides the shorter one.
While invisible, the target can turn, pick up or drop items without breaking the invisibility.
Attacking, casting abilities, or using items breaks the invisibility and resets the fade delay.
Does not grant phased movement.
SCEPTER Applies generic outgoing damage amplification on the ally target. Stacks additively with other sources of generic outgoing damage manipulation.
Affects spell damage the affected target deals. Does not amplify damage flagged as HP removal.
TALENT The False Promise armor  talent immediately updates all existing modifiers on already affected allies.

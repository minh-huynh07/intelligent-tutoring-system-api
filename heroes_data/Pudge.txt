meat hook link link qt abilitytarget point affectsenemies / allies( runes) damagepure / instant kill launches a bloody hook toward a unit or location. the hook will snag the first unit it encounters, dragging the unit back to pudge, killing it if it's a non-ancient creep and dealing damage if it is an enemy otherwise. cast animation: 0.3+0.59cast range: 1300max travel distance: 1300hook search

butcher's hook is a symbolic nightmare, its curved blade a frightening reminder of his slaughterous intent. the meat hook travels at a speed of 1600, taking 0.81 seconds to reach max distance. the ability's sound effects are audible to everyone and even through the fog of war. pudge receives the hidden modifier upon cast, which disables pudge. the duration of this modifier equals the time it takes for the hook to reach 66% of its max travel distance. this means with the default max distance of 1300, the self-disabling modifier can lasts up to 0.54 seconds. the duration is based on the max distance, including cast range bonuses. it does not matter how far the hook actually travels. upon latching on a unit, meat hook no longer self-disables. with the max travel distance and search radius, meat hook can hit units up to 1400 range away. the search radius is centered around the hook's tip. getting close to other parts of the hook has no effect. can only affect units while extending, not while retracting. fully affects invisible units. cannot hit ancient creeps, invulnerable or hidden units. the hook flies through impassable terrain and trees. it also can drag units over them. meat hook first applies its damage, then the disable. if the hook collides with a unit that is not a hero, strong illusion, clone or creep-hero, it instantly kills it in the form of hp removal. the damage dealt can be defined as expr 100% currenthp hooked enemies are fully disabled for the entire pull duration. allies are not disabled. they can act freely while being pulled by the hook. when the hook hits a unit, it provides a 4-second 500 radius flying vision at the unit's location upon hit. when the hook returns back but the snagged unit does not return together with hook (eg: teleporting when dragging), the snagged unit will be automatically teleported to the hook launch location. however, if the snagged unit is still affected by forced movement or upward movement when the hook returns back, the teleport will not apply. runes can be hooked as well. a successful rune hook instantly restores the mana cost. rot link wr abilitytoggle / aura affectsenemies / self

causes it to reduce enemy health regen. modifiers [?] modifier_pudge_rotdeatha foul odor precedes a toxic, choking gas, emanating from the butcher's putrid, ever-swelling mass. does not interrupt pudge's channeling abilities upon toggling on / off. the self-damage is never lethal, so it cannot be used to deny oneself. the area damage and self-damage are independent of each other, so when the self-damage is blocked, the area damage is still applied. the movement speed slow and damage are provided by an aura. this aura debuff lingers for 0.5 seconds. when an enemy leaves the area, the lingering debuff continues slowing and damaging until expiring. when rot is toggled off, the lingering debuff only slows, but stops dealing damage. deals 6/12/18/24 ( 24/30/36/42) damage in 0.2-second intervals. the time intervals are set for the whole game when rot is toggled on the first time. if toggled on, rot continues working even when silenced, disabled, or hidden. leveling up rot while already toggled on immediately updates the damage. the slow on already debuffed enemies is not updated. however, new enemies entering its area get slowed based on its current level. scepter rot's debuff now also applies heal reduction, health regeneration reduction, lifesteal reduction, and spell lifesteal reduction. immediately updates the damage when aghanim's scepter is acquired while toggled on, but not the radius. flesh heap ef abilityno target / passive affectsself gives pudge damage block against all sources. passively grants bonus strength that increases each time pudge kills an enemy hero or it dies in his vicinity. flesh heap is retroactive, meaning it can gain charges before it is skilled, which then become active. passive componentenemy death radius: 450kill radius:

new meaning to the words 'meat shield'. does not interrupt pudge's channeling abilities upon cast. flesh heap negates a portion of damage (after all reductions), causing several on-damage effects to not trigger if reduced to 0. does not negate damage on units affected by the following abilities: aphotic shield, defense matrix, refraction and resonant pulse. successive casts do not stack but refresh the duration. upon gaining a stack, a +1 indicator appears above pudge's head. the number of stacks and amount of strength granted can be seen on the status buff icon. grants a stack in the following conditions as long as pudge or the owner of the ability is alive: the enemy hero(es) dying within 450 radius, including denied enemy heroes. to gain a stack from outside the kill radius, pudge has to be credited for the kill. other player-controlled units do not count. when meepo or its meepo clones is instantly killed due to either the prime or any one of its clones dying. does not grant a stack in the following conditions: if the dying hero has reincarnation. from killing illusions and the tempest double. each stack effectively grants 24.2/30.8/37.4/44 ( 36.3/46.2/56.1/66) health, 0.1/0.13/0.15/0.18 ( 0.15/0.19/0.23/0.27) health regeneration and 1.1/1.4/1.7/2 ( 1.65/2.1/2.55/3) main attack damage bonus. leveling up the ability immediately updates all stacks to its new values. spell steal / morph notes the strength bonus per death last for the acquired ability's buff duration and is lost upon losing the ability. eject link de abilityno target affectsallied heroes ejects the swallowed allied hero inside of you. cast animation: 0+0ally order lock duration: 3 0 0ability draft notes: replaces dismember while the ally is swallowed, instead of being in a separate slot. allies emerge forever changed. requires aghanim's shard to be unlocked. interrupts pudge's channeling abilities upon cast. initially, this sub-ability is inactive until dismember is cast on an ally. upon cast, the ally is ejected, ignoring the order lock duration. the sub-ability then disappears from the hud completely instead of turning inactive again and reappears only when dismember is cast on allies again. swallowing a second ally hero with dismember automatically ejects the previous ally. the hero can simply get out of pudge themselves, by issuing any order 3 seconds after being swallowed. this means eject can regenerate a minimum of 15% of the ally's max health within its full order lock duration. the ally hero is also automatically ejected upon pudge's death. dismember link

modifier_pudge_dismember_pullstrong'when i'm through with these vermin, they'll be fit for a pie!' visual indicator above pudge when an ally is swallowed. fully disables the target as long as it is channeled. pulls the target closer to pudge at a speed of 75. the pull debuff disappears when the target gets within 125 range of pudge. provides true sight over the target upon cast. does not provide true sight if the affected target turns invisible while dismember is channeling, this does not interrupt the channeling as well. provides 200 radius ground vision over the affected target upon cast: 2.75 ( 3.5) seconds if the affected target is a hero. 5.5 ( 6.25) seconds if the affected target is a creep. this vision does not follow the affected target and its duration is independent of the channeling time. if the target turns invulnerable or hidden, the channeling stops instantly. treats clones and illusions as heroes. treats couriers as creeps and can be cast on enemy couriers. treats creep-heroes partly as heroes, and partly as creeps. uses the hero duration for creep-heroes, but uses the non-hero amount of ticks for them. however, the damage per instance is calculated to match the total damage a hero would take instead. dismember deals a fixed amount of intervals spread evenly over its full duration, with the first tick happening immediately upon cast. always heals for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much damage the target actually takes. pudge's dismember responses are global and audible to everyone, even through the fog of war. shard dismember can now be cast on ally heroes. treat clones and illusions as heroes, and creep-heroes as creeps. cannot be cast on allies who have disabled help from pudge. disjoints projectiles and applies a strong dispel on the ally target upon cast. the allied hero is invulnerable, hidden and spell immune while swallowed. therefore, the following abilities are dispelled upon being swallowed, despite only being dispellable by death: shallow grave, tether, battle trance and duel. only one hero may be swallowed at a time. however, pudge may cast dismember on an enemy target while swallowing an ally hero at the same time. shard during dismember, the allied hero is periodically moved to pudge's current position and prevented from acting, with the exception of toggling bulwark on / off. their auras are effectively bestowed around pudge until ejected. the periodic movement gets interrupted by teleport effects, without the ally getting ejected. they stay swallowed at the location they got teleported to. can fully regenerate the swallowed ally's health within 20 seconds. pudge receives the hidden modifier upon cast, which creates the visual indicator above him, visible to allies only. spell steal rubick's responses upon cast are not global and only audible to him, his dismember also does not use blade ringing sounds. soulbind prematurely ending the channeling only cancels dismember on the originally targeted enemy and does not affect the channeling on the other target, even with the leash debuff expired.

after reaching its final destination. with the cast range, travel distance, and effect radius, it can hit units up to 1440/1590/1755/1905/2070/2220/2385/2550 range away. the area between invoker and the targeted point is unaffected. chaos meteor rolls at a speed of 300 and always rolls the full distance, so it takes 1.55/2.05/2.6/3.1/3.65/4.15/4.7/5.25 seconds to reach the max distance. after landing, the meteor deals its main damage and places the burn debuff to units within its effect radius in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately upon landing. on each interval, the meteor first applies the damage, then the debuff. the main damage and burn debuff is applied separately, but they each can hit a unit up to 4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/ times. the following chaos meteor damage calculations are all before reductions: the main damage can deal up to 220/400/630/910/1240/1620/2050/2420 damage. the burn debuff deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after the debuff is placed, resulting in 3 instances for each debuff. the burn debuffs from each interval fully stack and do not refresh each other. one instance of the burn debuff can deal up to 30/45/60/75/90/105/120/135 damage. all possible instances of burn damage per unit together can deal up to 120/225/360/525/720/945/1200/1485 damage. therefore, the whole chaos meteor, main and burn damage, can deal up to 340/625/990/1435/1960/2565/3250/3905 damage when a unit is hit by all possible instances. talent 2 extra meteors are now launched with a 30 angle to the left and right of invoker. the angle is based on invoker's position. no matter the cast distance, the meteors always land and travel along offset by 30 from the centered meteor. the extra meteors land so that they are at least 200 range away from the centered meteor. this means when the targeted point is within 346 range of invoker, they land further ahead of the centered meteor to keep a minimum distance of 200. this means, unlike the centered meteor, the extra meteors cannot land within 400 range of invoker. expr travel distance: 300 + 150 wex + (15 0.5 (wex + 1) ) travel distance bonus: level 8 traveldistance + 15 main damage per

non-disabling forced movement, so affected enemies can still use abilities and items during it, and their channeling abilities are not interrupted. deafening blast first applies the knockback and

disarms him. affected units are moved in 0.03-second intervals, for 6/13/20/26/33/40/46/53 times. expr (quas 20/3) the knockback distance calculation is split up into two sections the first one-third and the remaining two-thirds intervals. in the first one-third intervals, the affected units are moved linearly by a distance of 6 per interval, up to 2/4/6/8/11/13/15/17 times, for a total of 12/24/36/48/66/78/90/102 distance. expr (6)( (quas 20/9 ) ) for the remaining two-thirds of the intervals 4/9/14/18/22/27/31/36 (i) times, the units are moved exponentially with 0.98 times the speed of each previous interval. the remaining intervals together (on each level) moves the affected units by a distance of 22.82/48.88/72.43/89.63/105.5/123.61/136.84/151.94, and can be defined as: expr 6 n = 1 i ( 0.98 n ) {\displaystyle 6\times \sum_{n=1}^{i}(0.98^n) } , where i is the remaining intervals. this can be calculated by taking the total intervals and subtracting the number of intervals in the first third. summed up, the total distance on each level is 34.82/72.88/108.43/137.63/171.5/201.61/226.84/253.94. as a conclusion, the knockback starts at a speed of 200 and decreases exponentially. talent the radial deafening blast talent releases blasts towards every direction around invoker, no matter where it is targeted. a total of 12 blasts are released. one blast is released towards the targeted point, while the other eleven are adapted to it, with 30 angles between them. a unit can only be hit by one blast per cast. if an enemy unit stands within the areas of multiple blasts, it is only affected by one. expr knockback duration: 0 + (0.2 quas) knockback distance: ( 6 quas 20 9 ) + ( 6 n = 1 i ( 0.98 n ) ) {\displaystyle (6 \times \lfloor \textbf{quas} \times

When invoking an ability that is already invoked, Invoke does not go on cooldown.
If the re-invoked ability was in the fifth ability slot, it moves into the fourth, swapping position with the other invoked ability.
The cooldown of previously invoked abilities is saved and is affected by all cooldown reduction sources.
When not using custom or Legacy Keys, the hotkey for the ability in the fourth slot and fifth slot is always D and F respectively.
Each level of Quas, Wex, Exort reduces the cooldown for Invoke by 0.3 seconds.

Ability invokes with 2 Quas and 1 Exort instances.
The Ice Wall is always created in front of Invoker, perpendicular to the line between Invoker and a point 200 range right in front of him.
Creates 15 wall segments, with a spacing of 80 between each, resulting in a total length of 1120.
Each segment affects a 105 radius around itself.
With the radius from both sides and the wall length, Ice Wall has an effective length of 1330.
Each segment has its own movement speed slowing aura. Its debuff lingers for 2 seconds.
The damage is independent of the movement speed slow, so getting further than 105 radius away from a segment immediately stops the damage, while the slow still lingers.
Deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after cast, resulting in up to 3/4/6/7/9/10/12/13 possible instances.

Invoker pulls a flaming meteor from space onto the targeted location. Upon landing, the meteor rolls forward, constantly dealing damage based on the level of Exort, and rolling further based on the level of Wex. Units hit by the meteor will also be set on fire for a short time, receiving additional damage based on the level of Exort.

Ability invokes with 2 Exort and 1 Wex instances.
Chaos Meteor needs 1.3 seconds to land. It lands at the targeted point within the cast range, not at Invoker's position.
The falling meteor visual effects and the sound during the 1.3 seconds effect delay are visible and audible to everyone.
Chaos Meteor provides 500 radius flying vision while it is rolling. This vision does not last.
Also provides the same vision for 3 seconds after reaching its final destination.
With the cast range, travel distance, and effect radius, it can hit units up to 1440/1590/1755/1905/2070/2220/2385/2550 range away. The area between Invoker and the targeted point is unaffected.
Chaos Meteor rolls at a speed of 300 and always rolls the full distance, so it takes 1.55/2.05/2.6/3.1/3.65/4.15/4.7/5.25 seconds to reach the max distance.
After landing, the meteor deals its main damage and places the burn debuff to units within its effect radius in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately upon landing.
On each interval, the meteor first applies the damage, then the debuff.
The main damage and burn debuff is applied separately, but they each can hit a unit up to 4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/ times.
The following Chaos Meteor damage calculations are all before reductions:
The main damage can deal up to 220/400/630/910/1240/1620/2050/2420 damage.
The burn debuff deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after the debuff is placed, resulting in 3 instances for each debuff.
The burn debuffs from each interval fully stack and do not refresh each other.
One instance of the burn debuff can deal up to 30/45/60/75/90/105/120/135 damage.
All possible instances of burn damage per unit together can deal up to 120/225/360/525/720/945/1200/1485 damage.
Therefore, the whole Chaos Meteor, main and burn damage, can deal up to 340/625/990/1435/1960/2565/3250/3905 damage when a unit is hit by all possible instances.
TALENT 2 extra meteors are now launched with a 30° angle to the left and right of Invoker.
The angle is based on Invoker's position. No matter the cast distance, the meteors always land and travel along offset by 30° from the centered meteor.
The extra meteors land so that they are at least 200 range away from the centered meteor.
This means when the targeted point is within 346 range of Invoker, they land further ahead of the centered meteor to keep a minimum distance of 200.
This means, unlike the centered meteor, the extra meteors cannot land within 400 range of Invoker.

Invoker unleashes a mighty sonic wave in front of him, dealing damage to any enemy unit it collides with based on the level of Exort. The sheer impact from the blast is enough to knock those enemy units back for a duration based on the level of Quas, then disarm their attacks for a duration based on the level of Wex.

Ability invokes with 1 Quas, 1 Wex and 1 Exort instances.
Deafening Blast travels at a speed of 1100 and always travels the full distance, which takes 0.91 seconds.
With the travel distance and end radius, Deafening Blast can hit units up to 1225 range away.
The complete area is shaped like a cone.
Applies a non-disabling forced movement, so affected enemies can still use abilities and items during it, and their channeling abilities are not interrupted.
Deafening Blast first applies the knockback and disarm at the same time, then the damage.
Can knock units over impassable terrain.
During the knockback, all trees the units collided with are destroyed.
Does not knock  Roshan back, but damages and disarms him.
Affected units are moved in 0.03-second intervals, for 6/13/20/26/33/40/46/53 times.
expr ⌊(Quas × 20/3)⌋
The knockback distance calculation is split up into two sections — the first one-third and the remaining two-thirds intervals.
In the first one-third intervals, the affected units are moved linearly by a distance of 6 per interval, up to 2/4/6/8/11/13/15/17 times, for a total of 12/24/36/48/66/78/90/102 distance.
expr (6)( ⌊(Quas × 20/9 )⌋ )
For the remaining two-thirds of the intervals — 4/9/14/18/22/27/31/36 (i) times, the units are moved exponentially with 0.98 times the speed of each previous interval.
The remaining intervals together (on each level) moves the affected units by a distance of 22.82/48.88/72.43/89.63/105.5/123.61/136.84/151.94, and can be defined as:

{\displaystyle 6\times \sum_{n=1}^{i}(0.98^n) }

, where i is the remaining intervals.
This can be calculated by taking the total intervals and subtracting the number of intervals in the first third.
Summed up, the total distance on each level is 34.82/72.88/108.43/137.63/171.5/201.61/226.84/253.94.
As a conclusion, the knockback starts at a speed of 200 and decreases exponentially.
TALENT The Radial Deafening Blast  talent releases blasts towards every direction around Invoker, no matter where it is targeted.
A total of 12 blasts are released. One blast is released towards the targeted point, while the other eleven are adapted to it, with 30° angles between them.
A unit can only be hit by one blast per cast. If an enemy unit stands within the areas of multiple blasts, it is only affected by one.

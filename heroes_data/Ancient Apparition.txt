caster's attack range and the bonus attack range from the ability. it can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. however, it is not affected by cast range bonuses. for ancient apparition, the total range for this ability is 735/795/855/915 ( 1035/1095/1155/1215). the bonus damage is applied as spell damage in a separate damage instance, it is affected by spell damage amplification and works with spell lifesteal. debuffs from successive casts fully stack, with each instance creating its own debuff. the attacks first apply the debuff, the

towards any location of the battlefield, which must be triggered again to mark the area to be blasted by a damaging explosion of hail. the further the tracer travels, the larger the explosion will be. enemies caught in the explosion, or who touched the icy ball of hail as it travels, are frostbitten, taking damage and prevented from regenerating or healing. if a frostbitten unit's health drops below a certain percentage, they will instantly shatter. cast animation: 0.01+1.07cast range: globalprojectile radius: 275min explosion radius: 275max explosion radius: 1000explosion damage:

modifier_ice_blastdeathice storms from ages past flow through kaldr's frosty limbs, crashing into the world and turning its inhabitants into monuments to his eternal power. upon cast, ice blast is replaced by the release sub-ability. the tracer projectile travels at a speed of 1500 until release is cast, ancient apparition dies, or it reaches the map boundaries. the tracer projectile itself is harmless. it neither deals damage nor places the debuff. the tracer is visible to allies only. the initial cast sound is also only audible to allies. the explosion radius starts at 275 and increases by 50 for every second the tracer has traveled, capped at 1000 radius. thus, it takes at least 15 seconds to reach the maximum radius, equaling 22500 units traveled. the tracer provides 500 radius flying vision around itself as it travels. this vision does not last. the debuff is only placed on heroes. treats clones and creep-heroes as heroes, and illusions as creeps. the debuff can also be placed on spell immune or invulnerable units, but not on hidden units. unlike the debuff, the explosion damage hits all enemy units, including creeps, excluding buildings and wards. the debuff freezes health and prevents the following current health increasing effects: flat current health sources. percentage-based current health sources. current health increase from strength items and/or from health bonus items. granite aura however, the debuff does not prevent the following sources from increasing health: setting health sources. max health increasing sources. from losing the whirling death debuff. from gaining/losing the decay buff/debuff. units affected by the debuff die instantly when their current health drops below the threshold. the debuff checks the unit's health upon taking damage, excluding damage flagged by hp removal. the kill is credited to the source of the damage which brought them below the threshold. however, if it was caused by self-inflicted damage, ancient apparition is credited instead. has a lower priority than winter's curse, so if affected by both, winter's curse takes priority. has a higher priority than reaper's scythe, so if affected by both, ice blast takes priority. the following sources prevent affected units from dying while below the kill threshold: min health (e.g. shallow grave). invulnerability the debuff deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after the debuff is applied, resulting in 10 instances. the debuff itself can deal up to lua error in module:calculate at line 59: bad argument #2 to 'gsub' (string/function/table expected). damage (before reductions). together with the explosion, ice blast can deal up to lua error in module:calculate at line 59: bad argument #2 to 'gsub' (string/function/table expected). damage. shard now applies the cold feet debuff based on its current level on all hit heroes, with a reduced stun duration of 0.96/1.2/1.44/1.68 seconds. cold feet applied by ice blast do not cost any mana, and are applied even if the ability itself is not castable. cold feet notes fully apply. if it is not leveled, no debuffs are applied. talent the area of effect talent does not upgrade these passively applied cold feets. release link link link rt abilityno target releases the ice blast to explode at the tracer's current location. cast animation: 0.01+1.1min projectile speed: 750max travel time: 1.75 1 0 replaces ice blast until the sub-ability is used or the tracer disappears. upon cast, the tracer stops traveling and marks the total area hit by the explosion once the main projectile reaches its position. the tracer then provides a 4-second 650 radius flying vision at that position. the ice blast projectile travels at a speed of 750, or reaches the targeted point 1.75 seconds after launch, whichever is faster. the projectile is only released when the sub-ability is cast, or when ancient apparition dies while the tracer is still traveling. it is not released when the tracer reaches the map boundary. in this case, the ability is wasted. every enemy unit that comes within 275 radius of the projectile as it travels, or is hit by the explosion, gets the frostbitten debuff. the debuff starts expiring only once outside of the range of the projectile. getting within range again immediately refreshes the duration. the projectile is fully visible to enemies and provides a 3-second 500-radius flying vision as it travels. however unlike the tracer, it is not visible on the minimap. ancient apparition is unable to level ice blast up while this sub-ability is active. spell steal grants ice blast if this sub-ability is the last cast ability.

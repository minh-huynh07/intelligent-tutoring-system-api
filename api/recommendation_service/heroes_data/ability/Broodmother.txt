her webs. the projectile travels at a speed of 1200. silken bola first applies the debuff, then the damage. the bonus damage is considered as a conditional attack damage bonus and is magical damage. although the attack damage bonus values are not displayed in the hud, it is still considered and directly added to the unit's attack damage. however, it is considered by lifesteal, crit or cleave, and it can be reduced only by flat reductions (e.g. magical damage barrier). since it is considered bonus attack damage, it is not affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions. the bonus damage only triggers for allied hero attacks (including illusions and clones, excluding creep-heroes), and any attacks done by units owned by broodmother. blind uses pseudo-random distribution. stacks additively with other blind sources and multiplicatively with evasion sources. successive casts do not update the ability values but refresh the duration. talent the area of effect talent turns silken bola into a 400 radius area-targeted ability, so that it cannot directly target units anymore. spinner's snare link link link dd abilitytarget point / vector targeting affectsenemies damagemagical broodmother may create up to 5 invisible web lines touching any existing web. enemy heroes that cross the web line will spring the trap, becoming rooted, revealed in fog, and take damage over time. multiple heroes can trip on the same line until it's destroyed after being initially triggered. broodmother's team is alerted via the minimap when an enemy has triggered the snare. cast

draft notes: requires drafting spawn spiderlings to be unlocked. the slightest tremor of her web is all arachnia needs to find her prey. requires aghanim's scepter to be unlocked. has a global cast range when there is a spin web within 800 range of the targeted point. the vector-targeted direction of spinner's snare is not considered, only the initially selected center point matters. cannot be cast within the vicinity of another web line. the vector must not overlap with another line to cast. the web line forms over a 2-second duration, during which the line is completely inactive. the web lines are completely invisible to the enemy and cannot be revealed. once formed, the line can trigger on enemy heroes and clones coming within its area of effect. treats illusions and creep-heroes as creeps. when triggered, allies get a ping on their minimap, while the triggering hero receives a single debuff that applies all ability effects. the modifier exposes the target, provides true sight over them, and slows their movement speed. after 0.25 seconds, the modifier roots the target, preventing them from moving and casting certain mobility abilities. this means the root effectively lasts 2.75 seconds. the damage over time starts immediately in the same interval after this delay as well, and ticks in 1-second intervals, resulting up to 4 instances. can deal up to 400 damage to the target (before reductions). invulnerable and spell immune units can trigger the snare but are not damaged. once triggered, the snare becomes visible to enemies and disappears after 3 seconds. this timer is independent of the debuff on the enemy, so removing the debuff does not cause the snare to disappear earlier. during this time, other enemy heroes still may get debuffed by the snare. the snares have no set duration, they last until triggered. exceeding the max allowed number of snares instantly destroys the oldest snare. the snares do not provide vision and are not visible through the fog of war to anyone. spawn spiderlings link link link rt abilitytarget unit affectsenemies damagemagical broodmother injects her young into an enemy unit, dealing damage. the spiderlings will hatch

separate debuff. the ability has a debuff stack limit of 7. if an enemy has already 7 instances of the debuff, a new cast does not affect them at all. spiderlings and spiderites are fully affected by spin web. talent the damage increasing talent immediately upgrades all of broodmother's currently flying spawn spiderling projectiles. the health increasing talent does not upgrade any of

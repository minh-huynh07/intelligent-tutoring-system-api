trigger. refracts the 3 damage types, including self-damage and damage from allies, but not heals and hp removal effects (e.g. sunder, soul ring etc.). has a lower priority than false promise. however, it still loses a charge when combined with the latter. damage below 5 (after reductions) is completely ignored. it is neither blocked nor consumes any block instances. does not negate any instant kill effects. grants unique flat bonus attack damage. although the bonus attack damage is displayed on the hud, refraction only grants the attack damage bonus when the attack projectile successfully lands on the target, then it reduces 1 attack damage bonus instance. missed or disjointed attacks do not reduce the attack damage bonus count. neither loses instances upon attacking allies nor applies the bonus damage to them. does not provide bonus damage when cast while an attack projectile is traveling, but still uses up one instance upon projectile hit. talent refraction now can be cast while stunned, cycloned, slept, taunted, hidden or while being affected by forced movement sources. it still cannot be cast while silenced, hexed or prevented from acting. templar assassin is unable to shift-queue this ability upon learning the talent. meld link link link link wd abilityno target affectsself / enemies damagephysical templar assassin conceals herself, becoming invisible as long as she remains still. if meld's invisibility is broken by attacking an enemy, lanaya will deal bonus damage to the enemy and reduce their armor for 12 seconds. cast animation: 0+0.53fade time:

as her covenant with the hidden temple. meld first applies a basic dispel, instantly turns templar assassin invisible and phased, then a stop order is issued. she can turn, pick up, drop, or attack items without breaking the invisibility, considering she does not move while doing so. the invisibility is lost upon reaching the cast point of abilities, upon landing an attack, or upon moving. forced movement sources also cancel meld if moved horizontally. after an attack projectile has been launched, templar assassin can perform any action without losing invisibility. however, if the projectile misses or is disjointed, the invisibility is lost at the moment it misses. does not break invisibility in the following conditions: upon a psionic projection cast. upward movement sources and teleporting effects (e.g. reverse polarity). templar assassin's next attack which connects with a unit applies the meld effects. meld first applies the armor debuff, the meld damage, the bash, then the attack damage. talent stacks with other bash sources, with its duration following the regular rule of stuns the longer one overrides the shorter one. the meld damage is dealt in a separate damage instance and counts as attack damage. since it is applied separately, it does not trigger attack modifiers (e.g. crit or lifesteal) or psi blades. killing a unit with the meld damage also does not trigger psi blades as well. neither the bonus damage nor the armor reduction from meld affects buildings. multiple instances of the armor reduction debuff fully stack. however, successive casts before the previous meld attack projectile landed does not apply its effects on the next attack. spell steal / morph notes invisibility persists upon losing ability. psi blades link eb abilitypassive affectsenemies damagepure templar assassin's psi blades slice through the attacked unit, splitting and damaging enemy units directly behind it, while gaining bonus attack range. for each unit it damages, the spill damage is reduced by a percentage. attack range bonus: 80/130/180/230 ( 200/250/300/350)spill area width: 90spill area length: 600/650/700/750 ( 720/770/820/870)attack damage

is reality. psi blades' damage area increases templar assassin's total attack range to 280/330/380/430 ( 400/450/500/550). the spill area has a rectangular shape, with a width of 90 and a length of 600/650/700/750 ( 720/770/820/870). the spill area starts at the attack target's location and extends beyond them. with her default attack range and psi blade's attack range bonus, psi blades can hit units up to 880/980/1080/1180 ( 1120/1220/1320/1420) range away. does not perform instant attacks. the projectiles deal regular spell damage. attack modifiers are only applied to the primary target. the initial spill damage equals the amount of damage the primary attack target took from the attack (after reductions). the attack's damage value is determined during templar assassin's attack point. this also means that the initial spill damage can be increased by critical strike, quell, and bash sources. conditional attack damage bonuses (e.g. javelin damage proc) are not applied. psi blade's damage has the following flags: no-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing its damage from utilizing spell lifesteal. no-spell-amplification flag, preventing its damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification. the 5% damage loss per target stacks additively, and is always based on the initial damage, not on the damage the previous target took. this means psi blades' damage reaches 0 after the 20th target. however, it still affects all enemies within its area, applying a 0 damage instance to further targets. fully procs on damage effects, such as corrosive skin, except for abilities which have a minimum damage threshold (e.g. gravekeeper's cloak). templar assassin's position is checked as the projectile hits the target, not upon launching. psi blades spill damage when attacking allies or wards which use flat health (e.g. plague ward). spill damage can hit courier and invisible units. it spills an instance of 0 damage when attacking wards that require a fixed amount of attacks to be destroyed. despite the visual effects, psi blades do not spill damage when attacking buildings. trap link dt abilityno target affectsenemies (psionic trap) damagemagical springs the nearest trap,

black and turns white once fully charged. the damage values are always based on the current level and talent upgrades upon triggering the trap, and are not set upon spawning the trap. the damage is sourced to templar assassin and not the trap itself. therefore, the damage is affected by outgoing damage manipulation and spell lifesteal. deals 27.5/32.5/37.5 ( 38.5/43.5/48.5) damage in 0.5-second

unit-targeting a specific meepo will cause all meepos to cast poof on the targeted meepo, if able. when ground-targeted, all meepos except the casting meepo will poof to the meepo nearest to the targeted location, if able. this interrupts the casting meepo's actions even though it does not poof. does not disjoint projectiles. poof deals its damage once at the cast location and once at the

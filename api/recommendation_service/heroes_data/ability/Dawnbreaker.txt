modifier_stunnedstrongacross the vast lineage of star progeny, there were multitudes unwilling to align with the aims of the children of light. to those who dared organize defiance, the children would dispatch valora and her hammer to show a measure of their power--to leave the rebels either shattered or set back to rights. starbreaker's custom targeting indicator. starbreaker cannot be cast under the following conditions: while the current instance of starbreaker is still active. while not wielding her weapon due to celestial hammer. while channeling solar guardian. double-tapping automatically casts it towards the current facing direction. during starbreaker, dawnbreaker gets moved towards the targeted direction at a set movement speed of 215. the movement is paused by other sources of non-disabling forced movement, but not interrupted. the movement is also paused once dawnbreaker's path is blocked by a cliff, barrier, or other pathing blocker. destroys trees within a 100 radius around dawnbreaker and may pass through buildings during the forced movement. can move dawnbreaker a total distance of 236.5 over 1.1 seconds. shard starbreaker now no longer moves dawnbreaker a fixed distance based on the set movement speed. instead, she has a minimum movement speed of 215 while active, preventing other movement speed slow sources from reducing it lower than the min value. therefore, starbreaker now causes dawnbreaker to path around trees and no longer destroys trees coming in contact. dawnbreaker cannot pass through buildings anymore. with the 25% self move speed slow, the distance moved is now defined as expr ms 0.825, minms = 215 when 215 for the entire duration. with dawnbreaker's base movement speed, it can move her for a minimum of 247.5 distance over 1.1 seconds. during the combo, dawnbreaker is disarmed, and unable to move or turn. items and abilities other than solar guardian and celestial hammer can be cast normally during the combo. with blink, the ability can only be cast in front of dawnbreaker, as casting it in any other direction would require turning. when cast perpendicularly or backward, it will be cast after starbreaker's animation. using mobility items or abilities does not cancel any aspect of starbreaker. starbreaker is canceled if dawnbreaker gets stunned, cycloned, hexed, taunted, feared, or hypnotized during it. however, getting silenced does not cancel it. causes dawnbreaker to perform instant attacks on enemies within the swipe and smash radii. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally, except for cleave. they also have true strike, and completely ignore disarms. luminosity only gains 1 charge per instance, regardless of how many enemies got hit by instant attacks on each instance. performs instant attacks in 0.55-second intervals, starting immediately upon cast, resulting in 3 instances. the effects of the ability are independent of the whirling animation. all enemies are hit at the same time at each interval. fully ignores couriers. the first 2 instances are applied within the 300 swipe radius around dawnbreaker. only these instances slow affected enemies' movement speed. the attacks first apply their damage, then the slow debuff. the last instance is applied within 300 radius and 250 range in front of dawnbreaker. this instance applies the stun with a small 90-range knock-up. the attacks first apply their damage, then the stun/knock-up debuff. the smash can hit units up to 550 range away from dawnbreaker. dawnbreaker gets stunned for 0.2 seconds upon performing the last smash attack of the combo. shard starbreaker now grants dawnbreaker spell immunity while active, but it does not apply dispel. also unlocks dawnbreaker's movement while active, allowing her to move normally, instead of using forced movement. however, her facing angle remains locked, meaning she cannot turn until it is finished. movement orders ignore her facing direction while active so that she can also move backward. other orders like items and abilities still require her to face toward the ordered direction. stops destroying trees around dawnbreaker once upgraded. acquiring aghanim's shard, while starbreaker is active, does not update the current cast. stacks multiplicatively with other magic resistance sources. increases dawnbreaker's magic resistance to 62.5%. with the magic resistance bonus from this source, every 10 points of intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 0.5%. [?] celestial hammer link link link link link wc abilitytarget point affectsenemies damagemagical dawnbreaker hurls her weapon at a target, damaging enemies struck along the way. the hammer pauses for 2 seconds at the destination before flying back to her, leaving a trail of fire that slows enemies. dawnbreaker can recall the hammer at any time, pulling her towards it so they meet in the middle.

remaining connection to the glow of her creators. despite visually using dawnbreaker's weapon, she is not disarmed, and her attack is not modified in any way while celestial hammer is active. dawnbreaker is unable to cast the following abilities while her weapon is out due to celestial hammer: starbreaker solar guardian the hammer travels at a speed of 1500 ( 2700) and until reaching the targeted point or the max distance within 0.47/0.6/0.73/0.87. upon returning, the hammer travels back at the same speed, or until reaching dawnbreaker within 1.5 seconds, whichever is faster. talent since both the max value of the cast range and projectile speed are increased evenly by 80%, the projectile travel duration remains the same. the hammer provides a 1-second 200 radius flying vision upon reaching the destination point. the hammer destroys trees and hits enemies that come within 200 range of it as it travels. if an enemy gets within 200 range of the hammer, all enemies within 200 range of the hammer get damaged. each enemy may get damaged by the hammer only once upon flying towards the destination, and once again upon returning. this means the hammer can deal 100/160/220/280 impact damage to each enemy. celestial hammer first deals the impact damage, then the fire trail applies the damage per second. the hammer only returns when having the caster modifier. when losing the modifier by dying, the hammer disappears after the pause, instead of returning. the fire trail is created along the path the hammer takes upon returning. it lasts 2.5/3/3.5/4 seconds from the moment it is created. this means the fire created at the starting location disappears earlier than the fire created at the ending location. the fire provides an aura that places a debuff on enemies within its 200 radius. the aura's debuff lingers for 0.5 seconds. the debuff deals 10/15/20/25 damage in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately upon being placed. this results in up to 7/8/9/10 possible instances. can deal up to 70/120/180/250 damage within the area for the entire duration. upon casting converge, both the hammer and dawnbreaker create a fire trail behind them as they move. celestial hammer's cooldown starts upon casting converge, not upon casting the ability itself. talent the movement speed slow increasing talent immediately upgrades all currently active fire trails, but not

distance value of 700/900/1100/1300 ( 1260/1620/1980/2340). this means it can move dawnbreaker for up to 0.47/0.6/0.73/0.87 seconds. talent since both the max value of the cast range and projectile

abilitypassive affectsenemies / allies after a number of attacks, dawnbreaker powers up, charging her next attack with a critical hit that heals all allied heroes within 650 units around her for a

[?]modifier_dawnbreaker_luminosityundispellable modifier_dawnbreaker_luminosity_attack_buffdeath diminished in power without access to the children's replenishing light, valora can still recharge herself and her allies by creating order from the chaos which resides within each fight. each successful attack was done on an enemy hero or creep adds one to the attack counting buff. luminosity gains 1 charge per instance of starbreaker, no matter how many enemies got hit by the instance. the buff is always present, but it is hidden when at 0 charges. does not count attacks done against allies, wards or buildings, nor the attack that triggers luminosity. neither the charges nor the attack buff has a duration and last indefinitely. however, the attack buff is dispelled upon death. upon losing the attack buff, the charges get reset as well. once the counter reaches 3 ( 2), dawnbreaker gains the attack buff. this buff causes the next attack to be an ensured critical strike and to lifesteal. dawnbreaker first lifesteals based on the critical strike damage dealt (after reductions), then allies within the radius are healed based on the lifesteal value. luminosity has an ensured critical strike, crits with a lower value have no effect if they proc, since the higher crit value takes priority. the lifesteal value itself can still be subjected to lifesteal manipulation sourced to dawnbreaker. the self-lifesteal of luminosity stacks additively with other lifesteal sources. allies are healed for 17.5%/20%/22.5%/25% of the powered-up attack if dawnbreaker attacks a hero. treat illusions and creep-heroes as heroes. heals for the following values if dawnbreaker attacks a creep while having the attack buff: dawnbreaker is healed for 21%/24%/27%/30% of the powered-up attack.

target towards the cursor. the yellow ring indicates the max teleport distance towards that target. solar guardian cannot be cast under the following conditions: while starbreaker is active. while not wielding her weapon due to celestial hammer. double-tapping automatically targets the cursor's current location. it cannot be targeted on the minimap, however, portrait-casting automatically targets dawnbreaker's current location. upon targeting, automatically searches for the closest valid target to teleport to within 1400 range of the targeted point. the following allied units are considered valid targets: heroes, illusions, clones and creep-heroes. if there is no valid target within range, an error message appears and it does not cast. once targeted, the destination is locked, it does not follow the target. while channeling, dawnbreaker cannot act, so she cannot manually cancel the channeling. the channeling can still be canceled normally from disables applied by other units. once the channeling succeeds, dawnbreaker also turns invulnerable, hidden, spell immune, unselectable, and still cannot act. once reaching this state, it cannot be interrupted anymore. dawnbreaker quickly ascents upwards until no longer visible, and stays in the air for the full flight duration. upon reaching the halfway mark of the flight duration, she is teleported towards the center of the destination. towards the end of the flight time, she quickly descends back onto the ground and applies the landing effects. while channeling and during the flight duration, pulses are created at the targeted point. the pulses heal allies and deal damage to enemies within the effect radius. the visual and audio effects created at the targeted location are visible and audible to everyone. the healing and damaging pulses happen in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately upon channel begin, resulting in 5 ( 11) pulses. neither heals nor damages invulnerable or hidden units. the heal does not affect dawnbreaker herself but affects her player-controlled units. can heal and damage units for up to 225/350/475 ( 660/990/1320) health. at the end of the flight duration, enemies within 500 ( 650) radius of dawnbreaker are stunned and take the landing damage. with the landing damage and all pulses, can deal a total of 280/410/540 ( 460/710/960) damage (before reductions). the landing first applies the damage, then the stun. destroys trees within a 350 radius around dawnbreaker upon landing. scepter the pulses at the destination area now also apply an evasion buff on allies with the same intervals as the heal, and lasts for 1.5 seconds. evasion uses pseudo-random distribution. stacks diminishingly with other evasion sources. during the flight, solar guardian is replaced by the solar guardian land sub-ability. acquiring aghanim's scepter partially upgrades the current cast of solar guardian. the pulses during the channeling and flight immediately start applying the higher heal value and the modifier. if acquired while channeling but before the flight begins, the flight uses the increased duration, and the sub-ability is granted. however, the pulses' duration does not update, so the pulses use the default duration, but the flight uses the upgraded duration. talent the radius increasing talent partially updates the current cast of solar guardian. the pulses during the channeling and flight are not updated. however, the radius for the landing damage and stun is. solar guardian land rr abilityno target affectsself can be cast to land dawnbreaker into the target

duration ends. can be used while stunned, silenced, cycloned, slept, taunted, hidden, or during forced movement. this sub-ability can still be used after dawnbreaker is airborne despite the hud showing dawnbreaker being silenced. cannot be used while hexed or prevented from acting. dawnbreaker is unable to shift-queue this ability. during the flight, solar guardian's landing point or its effect radius can be moved at a speed of 200 with move orders ( right click or m). however, the movement can not be paused with stop or hold position orders. attack orders behave like move orders while airborne, causing them to change direction as well. solar guardian notes fully apply. despite being a sub-ability, solar guardian land procs all on-cast effects like a regular ability.

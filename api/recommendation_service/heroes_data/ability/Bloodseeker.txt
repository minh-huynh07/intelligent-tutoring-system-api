amplification and works with spell lifesteal. the ability upgrade also heals bloodseeker based on the attacked target's max health per hit for its duration. always heal for the full amount per

maximum movement speed for bloodseeker, removing the 550 movement speed cap. when an enemy hero drops below 25% health, thirst exposes the target and provides true sight over them. when enemies are revealed by thirst, a debuff and particle effects are placed on them, which is visible to everyone. bloodseeker himself also gets a status buff and particle effects and speaks certain lines, making it clear that an enemy is currently being revealed by thirst. thirst is not triggered by enemy illusions, but is triggered by hero clones. it is not triggered by hidden enemy heroes but does react on invulnerable ones. the first stack is applied when an enemy hero is below 80% health and the last when below 26%. grants 0.29%/0.44%/0.58%/0.73% ( 0.62%/0.76%/0.91%/1.05%) movement speed for each

grants all bonuses at the maximum values, and the bonuses linger for 4 seconds. the bonuses are also granted if the enemy dies, regardless of the health percentage the enemy had right before the killing blow. however, the bonuses do not linger and disappear immediately in the following conditions: if the enemy regains health above the 80% max health threshold. if the enemy has reincarnation. upon buyback. this is how much movement speed bonus bloodseeker gains from thirst with a certain amount of heroes being below 25% of their max health: 2x hero: 32%/48%/64%/80% ( 68%/84%/100%/116%)

requires aghanim's scepter to be unlocked. the active component has an instant cast time, regardless of the ability's cast animations. does not interrupt bloodseeker's channeling abilities upon toggling on / off. toggling on activates the cooldown, and bloodseeker is unable to toggle the ability off until the cooldown finishes. this means blood mist drains at least 21% of max health before it can be toggled off. if toggled on, blood mist continues working even when silenced, disabled, or hidden. deals 0.7% of max health as damage to self and enemies in 0.1-second intervals, starting immediately when toggled. does not drain bloodseeker's health when he is either invulnerable or has a damage barrier active. health drain cannot bring the target's health below 1. the magical area damage and self-damage are independent of each other, so when the self-damage is blocked, the area damage is still applied. the movement speed slow is applied on each interval as well. blood mist first applies the damage, then the slow. with level 4 bloodrage on bloodseeker, blood mist deals 9.1% ( 9.8%) of max health as damage per second (before reductions). does not affect roshan. passively grants bloodseeker a universal damage barrier based on 100% of the overheal values from all sources of healing (e.g. thirst), including lifesteal (e.g. bloodrage) and spell lifesteal sources. the max capacity can be defined as expr 0.5 selfmaxhealth and decays at rate of 0.5% capacity per second. fully absorbs damage values of all damage types, causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity. stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources. universal damage barrier has the lowest priority in the group of damage barriers, its capacity is depleted last when combined with other damage-type barriers. however, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g. borrowed time or refraction), blood mist does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire. rupture link link rr abilitytarget unit affectsenemies damagepure causes an enemy unit's skin to rupture,

based on the distance. if the unit did not move, or moved a distance greater than 1300 between a check, no damage is applied. if the unit is invulnerable as a check occurs, the value is set to nil, so that it does not take damage on the next check, regardless of distance. despite the ability sound effects, affected units take no damage from abilities with upward movement (e.g. torrent), except pulverize. rupture deals the following amount of damage (before reductions) when the affected unit travels certain distances: 300 distance: 105/135/165 damage. 600 distance: 210/270/330 damage. 900 distance: 315/405/495 damage. 1200 distance: 420/540/660 damage. 1500 distance: 525/675/825 damage. with level 4 bloodrage on bloodseeker, rupture deals 13% ( 23.4%) current health as damage to the target. talent with the spell damage amplification increasing talent it deals 14% ( 25.2%) current health as damage upon cast. this is how much damage it deals for certain distances traveled with level 4 bloodrage (and with the spell damage amplification increasing talent). 300 distance: 136.5/175.5/214.5 ( 147/189/231) damage. 600 distance: 273/351/429 ( 294/378/462) damage. 900 distance:

initial damage again, however, the debuff does not stack but refreshes the duration instead. can be cast on couriers, dealing only its initial damage. cannot be cast on roshan. talent acquiring the rupture charges talent instantly grants 1 extra charge. with the talent, rupture goes on a 0.25-second cooldown when cast, to prevent accidental double-casts on the same target.

segment with a radius of 175, and cutting off and at a total angle of 230 . this means marci can dispose units in front of her, and to her left and right up to a certain degree without turning. moves the target in an arc over marci's head, with a height of 150. the throw always takes 0.5 seconds. the target is fully disabled and prevented from acting during the throw, and always lands 250 range behind marci, so the throw distance varies based on the target's location. destroys trees within 275 radius around the target upon landing. applies both the landing damage and movement speed slow within the landing radius on all enemies. the ability effects are fully applied as well on the affected target when throwing an enemy target. thrown allies are not affected, applying only the landing damage and movement speed slow. applies the movement speed slow and area damage around roshan, but does not move him. dispose first applies the movement speed slow, then the damage. the throw can only

the distance between the target and marci becomes greater than the sum of the current cast range and 700 at any time, the dash stops. with the cast range and the range limit buffer, rebound has a maximum leap distance of 1150/1250/1350/1450 ( 1250/1350/1450/1550). however, the projectile itself does not stop. if re-cast before the projectile reaches the target, it may cause the leap of the new cast to trigger earlier. upon reaching the target, marci leaps and faces toward the targeted direction. the leap has a min and max duration of 0.1 0.2 seconds, and a height of 200 250 respectively. during the dash and the leap, marci is fully disabled. grants the targeted ally the movement speed bonus once marci reaches them. marci does not land at the center of the area of effect. instead, she lands 64 range away from the center, towards where she leaped from. with the position offset and leap distance, the actual minimum and maximum distance is 86 386/486/586/686 ( 486/586/686/786). this means the damage and slow radius are always located 64 range in front of marci upon landing. destroy trees within 275 radius upon landing. the dash can only be interrupted by death or by other sources

unleash unlocks maximum attack speed and removes the 700 attack speed cap for marci. the 700/975/1325 attack speed bonus is only gained while having the flurry buff. an attack charge is consumed whenever an attack is executed (including attacks missed, from instant attack sources, and attacking allies). the number of remaining attacks is visible on the buff icon and on top of marci. the buff and the visual effects of the ability are visible to everyone. each attack first applies the 2-second movement speed and base attack speed slow debuff on the target, then deals its damage. this debuff is refreshed with each attack. upon finishing the flurry combo, unleash releases a pulse around the attack target on the last attack and removes the flurry buff. this pulse deals 50/100/150 damage within its radius and silences enemies affected. the attack releasing the pulse first applies pulse debuff, the pulse damage, the silence, then its own attack damage. upon starting a flurry combo, all attacks must be executed within 1 second, otherwise, the combo fails and the flurry buff is lost. upon losing the flurry buff in any way, the cooldown debuff is applied. if the flurry combo was executed successfully, marci's base attack rate is set to a fixed 2 seconds by this debuff afterward. this prevents her from performing attacks for 2 seconds after the last strike. the fixed attack rate resets as the next flurry starts, effectively preventing her from attacking for 1.5 seconds. if the flurry cooldown was applied by failing the combo, her base attack rate will not be changed and she can attack normally. once the cooldown debuff expires, she gains the flurry buff again, with a new set of 4/5/6 charges. this repeats indefinitely while unleash is active, there is no limit to how many flurry buffs can be gained. scepter unleash now first apply the flurry buff, then the basic dispel. while active, unleash releases pulses only with marci's abilities. it does not react to items cast or other abilities.

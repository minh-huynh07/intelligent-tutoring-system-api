(before reductions) per multicast level: 2x multicast: 1.8s stun, 140/260/380/500 ( 620/740/860/980). 3x multicast: 2.4s stun, 210/390/570/750 ( 930/1110/1290/1470). 4x multicast: 3s stun, 280/520/760/1000 ( 1240/1480/1720/1960). talent grants fireblast a 17% chance to passively proc on regular attacks. multicast notes fully apply. these procs do not trigger the cooldown and work while on cooldown, and do not cost mana. therefore, they do not proc on-cast effects either. the procs use pseudo-random distribution. adds an average of 26.18/48.62/71.06/93.5 (

the number of remaining attacks is visualized by the visual effect, with one fire orb orbiting the unit for each remaining instance. a number on the status buff shows the remaining charges as well.

when the item itself can target allies by default. cannot affect the same unit again per item ability cast. the item's notes and targeting restriction fully apply (e.g. items that can only target creeps cannot multicast on enemy heroes.). does not proc for helm of the dominator-based and urn of shadows-based items. visually proc for urn of shadows-based items, but its ability effects are not

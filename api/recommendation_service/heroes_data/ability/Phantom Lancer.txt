modifier_phantom_lancer_spirit_lanceanyazwraith's proficiency at spearing his family's meal of fish is proving quite useful in the battlefield. spirit lance illusion as they appear to allies. spirit lance travels at a speed of 1000. the lance first applies the debuff, then the damage. the illusion only spawns when the projectile successfully hits and damages or slows the target. the spirit lance-illusion spawns at different distances, at a random spot around the affected target as follows: the illusion spawns 58-distance away from the affected target in the following conditions: if both the caster and the affected target have the same collision size. if the affected target's collision size is 27 while the caster's collision size is 18 or vice versa. the illusion spawns 87-distance away from the affected target only when the target's collision size is greater than the caster's collision size. all illusions owned by phantom lancer within 675 range of phantom lancer also cast a fake spirit lance. they play the whole cast animation and release their fake lances at the same time the real lance is released. when illusions currently do not have any order and are standing still, they turn to face the target and cast the fake lances. when illusions are moving or attacking, they continue to do so and do not turn to face the target. they still play the cast animation, overriding their move or attack animations. when canceling the cast, the illusions still play the full cast animation, but do not release the fake lances. the fake lances do not interact with anything and do nothing on impact. illusions created by spirit lance have a static 5 and 5xp bounty which does not scale with levels. scepter the projectile bounces on another unit, prioritizing heroes, within a 750 radius. treat illusions and creep-heroes as heroes. does not bounce on invisible units or units in the fog of war. can only hit the same unit again per cast when all other valid targets within the jump distance are hit. once all valid units are hit, spirit lance starts jumping on the same units again. however, it still does not bounce on the same unit twice in a row, so a lone target is hit only once. if the current target turns invulnerable or hidden, it does not bounce upon the projectile reaching them. all bounces together can deal up to 210/420/630/840 ( 330/540/750/960) damage (before reductions). doppelganger link wd abilitytarget area affectsself phantom lancer briefly vanishes from the battlefield. after 1 second, phantom lancer and any of his nearby illusions reappear at a random position within the targeted location, along with two additional doppelgangers. extends duration of all illusions. the two added doppelgangers have different properties: one takes normal damage and deals none, while the other takes 500% bonus damage and deals 80% less damage. cast animation: 0.1+0cast range: 575reappear radius: 325illusion gather radius: 900reappear delay: 1number of

dread magus vorn's death imbued the phantom lancer with the ability to blend with all spectrums of light. two types of doppelganger illusion as they appear to allies. doppelganger disjoints projectiles and applies a basic dispel on phantom lancer and his affected illusions upon cast. phantom lancer and his affected illusions are invulnerable and hidden during the reappear delay. they are prevented from acting and it cannot be interrupted during the reappear delay. any order given during it is queued as the next order. it cannot be interrupted by anything except death. when getting teleported (e.g. with glimpse), phantom lancer still appears at the targeted area. phantom lancer and the 2 created illusions face the direction phantom lancer was facing upon cast. other illusions which got gathered keep their previous facing angle. phantom lancer and his illusions reappear in a formation shaped like a plus, with a bit of variation. illusions that were moving or attacking a target continue to move or attack their target after reappearing. destroys trees within 150 radius of phantom lancer and every affected illusion upon reappearing. all illusions gathered with doppelganger get their duration increased. the 2 illusions created with this cast are not affected by this. the duration extension happens upon cast, so they effectively gain 1 second extra duration, since it takes 1 second for the illusions and phantom lancer to reappear. however, illusions that are invulnerable and hidden while doppelganger is cast are not gathered, and their duration are not extended. the normal-damage-taking and no-damage-dealing illusion is brighter and can be distinguished by phantom lancer and his allies from other illusions. the 600% damage-taking and 20% damage-dealing illusion looks like any other illusion phantom lancer can create to enemies. illusions created by doppelganger have a static 5 and 5xp bounty which does not scale with levels. phantom rush link er abilitytoggle / passive affectsself when targeting an enemy for an attack, phantom lancer quickly charges into range, gaining a temporary agility boost. phantom lancer's illusions also have this ability. cast animation: 0+0min proc distance: 200max proc distance: 600/675/750/825 ( 900/975/1050/1125)haste speed: 800agility bonus: 10/20/30/40 ( 20/30/40/50)max haste duration: 5agility

modifier_phantom_lancer_phantom_edge_agilityany azwraith knows that on the field of battle, speed can mean everything. can be toggled off to not activate. requires a direct attack order (a or right click) to trigger. auto-attacks or ground-targeted orders do not trigger phantom rush. phantom rush can trigger on any target, including wards and buildings, except allied units. disarm or ethereal effects on phantom lancer do not prevent him from rushing. however, attack immune units (e.g. invulnerable, ethereal) cannot be targeted. upon triggering, phantom lancer receives the rush buff, which grants haste and phased movement. this buff lasts for up to 5 seconds, until phantom lancer successfully hits the rush target, or until he receives another order. non-targeted items do not cancel the rush. double-tapping item abilities count as self-targeting and therefore cancel the rush. the rush buff is also lost when phantom lancer gets stunned, cycloned, slept, hexed or hidden. roots do not cause phantom lancer to lose the buff, and he continues rushing once the effect expires. taunts cause phantom lancer to rush towards the taunting unit instead, without making him lose the buff. forced attacks caused by taunts do not make him lose it either. fear does not make him lose the buff either so he flees with the rush speed. when the target turns hidden, invisible, or moves into the fog of war, phantom lancer rushes towards the unit's last known location. phantom lancer gains the agility buff as soon as he loses the rush buff. it does not matter how he loses the rush buff, the agility buff is always gained. therefore, if the distance between phantom lancer and his target is less than the min proc distance, phantom lancer will neither receive the rush buff nor rushes to the target. the agility buff is directly granted in this case. effectively grants phantom lancer 1.67/3.33/5/6.67 main armor, 10/20/30/40 attack speed and main attack damage bonus. juxtapose rx abilitypassive (

modifier_invulnerabledeath modifier_phantom_lancer_juxtapose_cacheundispellable modifier_phantom_lancer_juxtapose_invisibilitydeath ability draft notes: the vengeance illusion uses the hero proc chance, instead of the illusion proc chance. each of azwraith's lance attacks feels like two from a normal warrior; or three; or four... juxtapose illusion as they appear to allies. the proc chance neither requires mana nor has a cooldown despite visually having one. the mana cost and cooldown are for the ability upgrade. the chance to spawn illusions only triggers upon attacking, including instant attacks. works against attacking wards, but not buildings. juxtapose uses pseudo-random distribution. illusions created by juxtapose attack the target that the ability was triggered upon. this means that illusions created by juxtapose use phantom rush when their target is in the correct range. illusions created by juxtapose have a static 5 and 5xp bounty which does not scale with levels. the illusion spawns 72 range away from phantom lancer, appearing either north, east, south, or west from him. juxtapose works for all illusions that have this passive ability, no matter the owner or illusion creator, it is not exclusive only to phantom lancer's abilities. this includes illusions created with items (e.g. manta style) or with other abilities (e.g. reflection). this means that even enemy illusions of phantom lancer have a chance to spawn new ones for the owner of the illusion. shard adds an active component to juxtapose with the passive effects still present. the invisibility buff duration and illusion duration are independent of each other. the illusion created automatically walks forward in the direction phantom lancer was facing upon cast for 4 seconds. shard the invisibility buff is lost upon reaching the cast point of abilities or items, or upon landing an attack. missed attacks do not break it. grants phased movement while fully invisible and allows phantom lancer to path through other units, including wards, but not through buildings. phantom lancer can pick up, drop, or attack items without breaking the invisibility. successive casts refresh the invisibility duration.

temporarily disrupting an enemy's connection to their own body. the projectile travels at a speed of 1200. applies all of the abilities' effects to enemies within the effect radius regardless if the targeted unit is an ally or an enemy. enemies within the effect radius are always dispelled, while the allies can only be dispelled when unit-targeted. therefore, only one ally can be dispelled per cast. the buff/debuff of fate's edict is always dispelled by fortune's end. double-tapping automatically targets self. fortune's end first applies the basic dispel, the debuff, then the damage. can directly be cast on invulnerable units, fully affecting them, though the damage gets negated by the invulnerability. does not affect hidden targets. when the projectile connects with either an invulnerable or hidden unit, it still affects other units within the radius, but not the primary target. can be cast on and fully affects ally couriers, but not enemy couriers. can neither target, nor affect wards and buildings. applies a visual effect on the targeted unit upon cast, indicating that it is directly targeted. this visual effect is visible to everyone. the sound during the channeling is audible to everyone as well. the channeling is not canceled regardless of the target's current status effects (e.g. turning invisible, invulnerable etc.). however, when the channeling is interrupted through disabling oracle, the projectile is released prematurely. only the root duration is based on the max channel time. the duration starts at 0.75 ( 1.25) and increases by 0.08 per 0.1-second channeled, reaching 2.75 ( 3.25) in 2.5 seconds. talent the instant fortune's end talent removes the need for channeling and causes the projectile to be released instantly on max power. has a cast backswing of 0.3 upon learning the talent. selecting the talent while already channeling fortune's end visually removes the channeling bar, but does not interfere with the cast in any way.

allies who have disabled help from oracle. disarms the affected enemy target, but does not set their magic resistance. fate's edict always places a debuff on the target, regardless of the target's faction. this means if cast on self or an ally, allies can dispel it, while enemies cannot. fortune's end can always dispel the modifier, regardless of the target's faction. since it applies a debuff on allies, any dispel (e.g. false promise or echo shell) will dispel it from allies. vice versa, if cast on enemies, enemies can dispel it, while allies cannot. purifying flames link ee abilitytarget

cast. can be cast on illusions and creep-heroes. double-tapping automatically targets self. false promise fully negates damage (after most reductions), causing several on-damage effects to not trigger. instant killing effects (e.g. culling blade) are not prevented, and the following effects are also not negated: max health bonuses of strength gained from any sources. setting health sources. while active, false promise registers every damage instance (after reductions) the target would receive and keeps them in order. all healing instance received is summed up and doubled (before other amplifications and reductions). for false promise, only healing sources and health regeneration values are considered as on-heal effects. at the end of the duration, false promise checks to see if the sum of damage received is greater than the sum of healing received. then, the heal sum gets subtracted from each individual damage instance in order. this is repeated until either all damage instances are negated by the heal, or until the summed heal value depletes. if the heal sum depletes, then the remaining damage instances get applied in order. if the target dies, the kill is credited to whoever's instance that dealt the killing blow. in case the damage is from an ally, then the target is denied. if all damage instances are negated, the remaining heal value is applied as a single heal to the target. for a more detailed example explaining these interactions, please refer to the example below. while active, the following abilities grants the following amount of healing received: each purifying flames heal per second instances provide 30/50/70/90 healing recieved instances. scepter rain of destiny can provide up to 752/896/1040 ( 896/1040/1040) healing received within the radius. further increases purifying flames heal per second to 36/60/84/108 healing received instances within the radius. the remaining damage applied at the end of the duration has the hp removal flag, and the no-multiplier flag, preventing its damage from being affected by any generic damage manipulation. non-lethal damage instances delayed during false promise remain non-lethal when re-applied at the end of the duration. certain damage negation sources (e.g. gravekeeper's cloak or mischief) may reduce or avoid the damage applied at the end of the duration. if the target is invulnerable as false promise expires, the effects are applied as soon as the target is vulnerable. successive casts on the same target do not stack but refresh the duration. both the damage and heal value counters are not reset. scepter false promise also grants the target invisibility buff with a 0.15-second fade delay. as long as the buff is present, the target will keep turning invisible. during the fade delay, the target can still cast abilities, use items and perform attacks. scepter invisibility sources with fade delays use the same modifier and do not stack with other invisibility sources of the same type the longer duration overrides the shorter one. while invisible, the target can turn, pick up or drop items without breaking the invisibility. attacking, casting abilities, or using items breaks the invisibility and resets the fade delay. does not grant phased movement. scepter applies generic outgoing damage amplification on the ally target. stacks additively with other sources of generic outgoing damage manipulation. affects spell damage the affected target deals. does not amplify damage flagged as hp removal. talent the false promise armor talent immediately updates all existing modifiers on already affected allies.

[?]modifier_sandking_burrowstrikedeath modifier_sandking_impalestrongability draft notes: caustic finale must be drafted as well for it to get applied. crixalis often lies in wait, burrowing under the surface to ambush his adversaries. the spikes travel at a speed of 2000, reaching max range in 0.26/0.3/0.34/0.38. the spikes do not travel the full distance when targeting closer than the max range. sand king is teleported instantly towards the targeted point once the spikes reach it. does not disjoint projectiles upon cast or upon teleporting. the burrowing and reappearing takes 0.53 seconds from the moment the ability is cast, during which sand king is disabled and prevented from acting. when unit-targeted, sand king chases the target until it is within range and casts burrowstrike toward its direction. the spikes still do not home in on the target, and thus can be evaded. unit-targeting only determines the direction upon cast. these interactions mainly affect burrowstrike's spell reflection as follows when reflected: when reflected, if the cast range is less than the range between sand king and the target, the reflected burrowstrike will be cast on the spot where sand king originally casts the ability. when the distance between sand king and the target is equal or greater than the cast range, burrowstrike will be reflected toward sand king as a unit-targeted ability. whether sand king is hit by burrowstrike depends on the distance between the two, as well as the burrowstrike speed. hit units are knocked up 350 range for the initial 0.52 seconds of the stun. while in the air, other units may pass below hit airborne units. the damage is applied upon landing, not upon getting hit. with the max cast range and radius, it can hit units up to 675/750/825/900 range away. burrowstrike first applies the stun debuff, the caustic finale debuff based on its current level, then the damage on all hit heroes. treats clones as heroes, illusions and creep-heroes as creeps. caustic finale notes fully apply. the debuff is applied even if it is not leveled, but does nothing. spell steal / morph notes caustic finale applied is based on sand king's current ability level when acquired. soulbind the caster appears at the unit-targeted location. the burrowstrike cast first hits the secondary target, then the primary target. sand storm link wr abilityno target / aura affectsenemies / self damagephysical sand king creates a fearsome sandstorm that damages enemy units while hiding him from vision. the sandstorm follows sand king at

channeling abilities upon cast. upon cast, an aura is created centered around sand king based on his current position and turns him instantly invisible. all effects are provided by an aura, its aura lingers for 0.5 seconds. the visual effects indicating sand storm's radius are visible to both allies and enemies. sand storm follows sand king while he moves at a speed of 25/50/75/100. while invisible, he can move, turn, pick up or drop items without breaking the invisibility. does not grant phased movement. attacking, casting abilities, or using items breaks the invisibility and the fade delay takes effect. as long as the aura is present, sand king will keep turning invisible. during the fade delay, he can still cast abilities, use items and perform attacks. however, since casting sand storm applies the invisibility instantly, the fade delay does not take effect when re-casting it within the previous radius. invisibility sources with fade delays use the same modifier and do not stack with other invisibility sources of the same type the longer duration overrides the shorter one. deals 5/9/13/17 ( 8/12/16/20) damage in 0.2-second intervals, starting immediately upon cast, resulting in a total of 100/125/150/175 instances. can deal up to 500/1125/1950/2975 ( 800/1500/2400/3500) damage to a single unit (before reductions) within the area for the entire duration. the aura linger duration does not affect the damage per second component. scepter 2 burrowstrike spines based on its current level is created in 0.2-second intervals, starting immediately upon cast, resulting in a total of 200/250/300/350 spine instances. the spines are created in random locations within the radius, do not have a target priority, and apply both the burrowstrike and caustic finale debuff based on its current level. the spines spawn radius is divided into four 90 segments (0 90 , 90 180 , 180 270 , 270 360 ). the first explosion occurs within the upper semicircle (0 90 and 90 180 ) separately and simultaneously, following explosions proceeding counterclockwise at the bottom semicircle (180 270 and 270 360 ) separately and simultaneously as well 0.2 seconds later, regardless of facing direction. the explosions alternate between the top and bottom semicircle every 0.2 seconds. the aura linger duration does not affect the spines per interval component as well. scepter the burrowstrike spines also do not spawn within radius of a previously created spine. if burrowstrike is not leveled, or if the caster does not have burrowstrike, it is not applied. both burrowstrike and caustic finale notes fully apply. talent the storm movement speed talent immediately updates the current active instance. the same aura now blinds enemy units within the radius and applies a 35% movement speed slow. blind uses pseudo-random distribution. stacks additively with other blind sources and multiplicatively with evasion sources. spell steal / morph notes upon losing ability, sand

injection from crixalis makes one brittle and as dry as the arid wastes, subject to implosive demise. the area damage triggers only when the unit is killed by one of its enemies while having the debuff on. this means the unit does not explode in the following conditions: when being denied. summons and illusions when its duration expires. when killed without a credited source. when meepo or its meepo clones is instantly killed due to either the prime or any one of its clones dying. when an illusion dies with the debuff, only the base damage is applied within the radius, the max health as damage is not applied. successive attacks on the same target do not stack and do not update the debuff values, but refresh the duration. all caustic finale values are set upon the initial debuff placement. the debuff is not placed on allies, buildings, and wards. epicenter link link rc abilityno target ( passive) affectsenemies damagephysical after a cast point of 2 seconds, sand king sends a

modifier_sand_king_epicenter_slowanymany an explorer was lost to the quicksands of the scintillant waste. once cast, the damage pulses cannot be canceled in any way, not even by sand king's death. the pulses are all centered on and follow sand king. the pulses happen in 0.5/0.375/0.3 ( 0.27/0.23/0.2)-second intervals, starting 0.5/0.375/0.3 ( 0.27/0.23/0.2) seconds after cast. this means it takes 3

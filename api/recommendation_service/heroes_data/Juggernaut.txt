[?] blade fury directly negates juggernaut's attack damage while active. however, it does not reduce conditional attack damage bonuses (e.g. pierce or shadow walk). despite the ability's visual effects, this effectively causes critical strike, lifesteal, and cleave to have no effect, since these mechanics rely on attack damage values. although the reduction values are not displayed in the hud, it is still considered and directly subtracted from juggernaut's attack damage. stacks additively with other total attack damage reduction sources. deals 18/23/28/33 ( 24/29/34/39) spell damage in 0.2-second intervals, starting 0.2 seconds after cast, resulting in 25 damage instances. can deal up to 450/575/700/825 damage to a single unit (before reductions). does not affect couriers. shard increases juggernaut's movement speed to 375 and performs instant attacks on random enemies within the radius in 1.4-second intervals, starting 0.2 seconds after cast, resulting in up to 4 attacks. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. they do not have true strike, but completely ignore disarms and stuns. the instant attack targets are chosen randomly, there are no priorities. the instant attack from the ability upgrade is independent of blade fury damage negation component, and neither affects buildings nor wards. it is considered as attack damage and is affected by damage block. shard the instant attacks' damage can be defined as expr (mainatk + bonusatk) 75%. does not reduce conditional attack damage bonuses. stacks additively with other total attack damage reduction sources. for ranged heroes, since instant attacks use their regular attack projectiles, conditional attack damage reduction still applies to their attacks, causing each of their instant attacks to deal an instance of 0 damage. still does not affect couriers. talent with the damage increasing talent, it can deal up to 600/725/850/975 damage. healing ward link wg

damage by an average of 18%/22.5%/27%/31.5%. a critical strike proc is determined during juggernaut's attack point. when a critical strike procs, juggernaut uses a specific crit attack animation, and particle effects appear on his weapon. the proc chances of multiple critical strike sources stack. if two sources of critical strike proc at the same time, the higher crit multiplier has priority. does not proc against wards, buildings and allies. blade dance uses pseudo-random distribution. talent stacks additively with other lifesteal sources. swiftslash link dw abilitytarget unit

scepter to be unlocked. swiftslash cannot be cast during blade fury. does not require omnislash to be leveled to be unlocked, once aghanim's scepter is acquired. however, it relies on omnislash to work, since it directly uses its values. this means when omnislash is not learned, swiftslash does nothing upon cast. omnislash notes fully apply. swiftslash is distinguished by blue particles, as opposed to the orange particles of omnislash. omnislash link re abilitytarget unit affectsenemies / self damage instant attack juggernaut leaps towards the target enemy units, and then slashes the

juggernaut spell immune, invulnerable, unselectable, rooted for the whole duration, and applies a basic dispel on cast. juggernaut can cast abilities and use items during omnislash. however, blade fury is inactive for the duration and cannot be cast. during omnislash, juggernaut does not need to turn in order to cast targeted abilities or items. the slash interval can be defined as expr (100 1.4) / ( as 1.5) with the attack speed limits, the min and max possible slash intervals are 0.133 4.667 seconds plus a server tick per slash respectively. the interval is not set upon cast. on each slash, the interval updates based on his current attack rate. causes juggernaut to perform instant attacks on enemies he slashes. grants flat bonus attack damage while omnislash or swiftslash is active. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. they do not have true strike, but completely ignore disarms. can neither be cast on nor jump on wards, and buildings. can be cast on couriers, but not jump on them. can jump on invulnerable, attack immune and ethereal units. however, the instant attacks do not trigger. cannot jump on units in the fog of war, invisible or hidden units and undying zombies. if no valid targets can be found within range and within 0.15 seconds after the previous jump, omnislash ends prematurely. on each slash, juggernaut is positioned at the opposite side of the target from juggernaut's position, facing the target. the slash radius is centered around juggernaut, not around the current target. provides a 1-second 200 radius flying vision lasting on each slash around the current target. recasting omnislash while the previous cast is still active cancels the previous cast and starts a new instance. this also applies when swiftslash is cast during omnislash, the former canceling the latter and vice versa. centers the player's camera perspective on juggernaut upon cast, following his position during omnislash.

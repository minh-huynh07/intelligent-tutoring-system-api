upon cast. naga siren is invulnerable, hidden and spell immune during the 0.5-second split time. after the 0.5-second split time, naga siren reappears with her illusions. the reappear locations are based on naga siren's position upon cast, with one appearing at the cast location, and the others north, east, south, or west from that point. this means when spawning 3 illusions, the formation is t-shaped and when spawning 4 illusions, it is shaped like a plus. though the formation is always the same, naga siren and her illusions take a random position in the formation and have all the same facing angle. the illusions have a expr 2 illusionlvl bounty. the distance in between each created illusion is 108-distance if the caster's collision size is 27, and 72-distance if its collision size is 18. orders the caster to stop after the split time, canceling all queued orders, and orders given during the split time. also stops all ongoing targeted orders of other units that have been issued

they turn to face the target and cast the fake nets. when illusions are moving or attacking, they continue to do so and do not turn to face the target. they still play the cast animation, overriding their move or attack animations. when canceling the cast, the illusions still play the full cast animation, but do not release the fake nets. the fake nets do not interact with anything and do not root. scepter increases the default cast range to 800/840/880/920. stacks additively with other sources of percentage-based cast range manipulations, and is calculated after all flat cast range

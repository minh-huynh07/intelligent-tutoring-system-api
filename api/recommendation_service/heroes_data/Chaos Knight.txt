bolt, and causes it to create a phantasm illusion to attack the target. spell block / reflection notes:blocked upon impact.modifiers [?] modifier_stunnedstrongability draft notes: phantasm must be drafted as well for the illusion to spawn. even chaos knight cannot predict this manifest of unholy energy. phantasm illusion created upon chaos bolt projectile impact. chaos bolt travels at a speed of 700, in a parabolic curve toward its target. stun duration and raw damage values are shown above the target's head upon hit, visible to allies and enemies, with the duration being shown as a rounded integer up to two decimal places. however, the actual stun duration is not by exact seconds it ranges between the min and max values (e.g. level 1 could stun for 1.72 seconds). both the damage and stun values are inversely related, the longer the stun is, the less damage it deals, and vice versa. this means the damage decreases by 12/12/12/12 per each additional 0.1 seconds of stun. has the following values for the damage and stun duration on each level: level 1 1.25s 150, 1.375s 135, 1.5s 120, 1.625s 105, 1.75s 90 level 2 1.5s 210, 1.6875s 187.5, 1.875s 165, 2.0625s 142.5, 2.25s 120 level 3 1.75s 270, 2s 240, 2.25s 210, 2.5s 180, 2.75s 150 level 4 2s 330, 2.3125s 292.5, 2.625s 255, 2.9375s 217.5, 3.25s 180 talent since both the minimum and maximum value of the stun duration are increased evenly by 0.6, the above damage values remain the same. the bolt first applies the debuff, then the damage. all illusions owned by chaos knight within 675 range of the target also cast a fake chaos bolt. they play the whole cast animation and release their fake bolt at the same time the real bolt is released. when illusions currently do not have any order and are standing still, they turn to face the target and cast the fake bolt. when illusions are moving or attacking, they continue to do so and do not turn to face the target. they still play the cast animation, overriding their move or attack animations. when canceling the cast, the illusions still play the full cast animation but do not release the fake bolt. the fake bolts do not interact with anything and do not damage or stun the target. shard chaos bolt now creates 1 controllable phantasm illusion upon projectile impact, based on its current level. does not spawn an illusion, if the projectile gets disjointed, or the target is invulnerable, hidden or spell immune upon impact. if it is not leveled, or if the caster does not have phantasm, the illusion does not spawn. phantasm notes fully apply. the illusion spawned automatically starts attacking the affected enemy. dispelling the stun or dying does not remove already spawned illusions. shard the phantasm illusion spawns at different distances depending on the caster and affected target's collision size as follows: the illusion spawns 58-distance away from the affected target in the following conditions: if both the caster and the affected target have the same collision size. if the affected target's collision size is 27 while the caster's collision size is 18 or vice versa. the illusion spawns 87-distance away from the affected target only when the target's collision size is greater than the caster's collision size. morph notes the ability upgrade creates phantasm illusions despite not having the ability. reality rift link we abilitytarget unit

it. the target is then teleported 62 range in front of that location, so they effectively get pulled by 238/288/338/388 ( 463/513/563/613) range. chaos knight's illusions are also teleported around the target from random angles, with the same distance to it as chaos knight. the location is determined at the beginning of the cast. a visual effect while casting denotes the point at which chaos knight and his target will land. also plays a visual effect at the location of any nearby allied illusions while casting, even illusions not actually owned by chaos knight. if the enemy has vision of chaos knight or the target, these visual effects can be seen through the fog of war. chaos knight and his illusions are made to face his target and are issued an attack order against the target. when cast on roshan, chaos knight and his illusions still get moved, but roshan does not. the armor debuff is applied to the target upon cast. chaos knight does not need to attack it in order to place the debuff. the debuff from successive casts does not stack but refreshes the duration. does not interrupt the target's channeling abilities. talent fully affects couriers upon learning the reality rift

clones, illusions, creep-heroes and roshan as heroes. a critical strike proc is determined during chaos knight's attack point. when a critical strike procs, chaos knight uses a specific attack animation, and particle effects appear on his weapon. the proc chances of multiple critical strike sources stack. if two sources of critical strike proc at the same time, the higher multiplier has priority. stacks additively with other lifesteal sources. does not proc against wards, buildings and allies. chaos strike uses pseudo-random distribution. phantasm link rt abilityno target affectsself

modifier_chaos_knight_phantasm_illusiondeath modifier_illusiondeath modifier_invulnerabledeath drawing on his battles fought across many worlds and many times, phantasms of the chaos knight rise up to quell all who oppose him. phantasm illusions' formations. phantasm first disjoints projectiles upon cast, then applies a basic dispel on chaos knight after the split time. chaos knight is invulnerable, hidden and spell immune during the 0.5-second split time. also provides 400 radius flying vision around chaos knight upon cast during the split time. after the 0.5 seconds split time, chaos knight reappears with his illusions. the reappear locations are based on chaos knight's position upon cast, with one appearing at the cast location, and the others north, east, south, or west from that point. this means when spawning 3 illusions, the formation is t-shaped and when spawning 4 illusions, it is shaped like a plus. for chaos knight, when the number of illusions spawned is 3, two random illusions may spawn in the same coordinates, and one of them will be pushed 58-distance away. though the formation is always the same, chaos knight and his illusions take a random position in the formation and have all the same facing angle. all phantasm-based illusions have a expr 2 illusionlvl bounty. the illusions spawn at different distances depending on the caster's collision size as follows: the illusions spawned are 135-distance or 90-distance away if the caster's collision size is 27 or 18 respectively. scepter for ally heroes, the illusions spawned are 81-distance or 54-distance away if the affected ally's collision size is 27 or 18 respectively, following the same collision size notes if the illusions spawned are too close to each other. orders the caster to stop after the split time, canceling all queued orders, and orders given during the split time. also stops all ongoing targeted orders of other units that have been issued before phantasm was cast. successive casts replace the phantasm illusions from the previous cast, no matter under whose control they are, except for the following situations: when the illusion is enchanted. when the illusion(s) are affected by hidden or invulnerability sources. phantasm illusions are strong illusions, meaning they cannot be instantly killed by abilities that normally kill illusions instantly. scepter phantasm now creates 1 illusion of every ally hero, globally, under chaos knight's control. does not affect invulnerable or hidden allies. treat clones and the spirit bear as heroes and creep-heroes as creeps. applies a basic dispel on affected allied heroes, but does not disjoint projectiles. neither turn ally heroes invulnerable nor hidden. therefore, it neither interrupts their current orders nor disjoints projectiles for them. the same illusion formation notes apply to these illusions as well.

swipe's damage is considered as a conditional attack damage bonus. although the attack damage bonus values are not displayed in the hud, it is still considered and directly added to ursa's attack damage. the attack damage bonus values are not considered by critical strike. however, it is considered by lifesteal and cleave, and it can be reduced only by flat reductions (e.g. damage block). since it is considered bonus attack damage, it is not affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions. on each attack fury swipes first adds 1 stack and then deals damage based on the stack count. this means that the bonus attack damage is applied even with the first attack. each successful attack refreshes the duration, ability and talent upgrade values of the whole stack. missed attacks neither place the buff, nor add a stack or refresh it. the number of fury swipe stacks is visible on the debuff icon placed on affected units. for how much damage fury swipe deals on each

causing far greater pain than he himself feels. the 3% current health as cost counts as setting health. current health as cost is non-lethal. therefore, this ability can be cast even with 1 health. burning spear's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range as the caster. however, it is not affected by cast range bonuses. uses huskar's 400 attack range when autocast is active. manually casting it uses the 450 cast range. places two debuffs on the target with each attack the first debuff gets refreshed, while the second debuff is stacked. a number on the first debuff's icon shows the number of stacks, visible to everyone. the stacks' durations are independent of each other. successive casts do not refresh the duration of previous casts. the debuff modifier is only placed once and refreshed with successive casts. the debuff deals damage 1 second after it is applied, and can be defined as: expr 5/10/15/20 ( 9/14/19/24) stacks the damage is decided by the ability's level upon placing the debuff modifier. therefore, placing new burning spear stacks with a higher ability level on targets with old active stacks uses the old damage value. can deal up to 45/90/135/180 ( 81/126/171/216) damage per burning spear instance (before reductions). cannot be cast on buildings, wards, and ally units. talent both the damage per second increasing and the pure damage talents immediately update all current active burning spear stacks. berserker's blood eb abilitypassive affectsself huskar's injuries feed his power, giving increased attack speed, magic resistance and health regen based on missing health. health regen is a percentage of your strength. max attack speed bonus: 160/210/260/310max magic resistance bonus: 10%/15%/20%/25%strength as max health regen bonus: 25%/40%/55%/70% ( 50%/65%/80%/95%)max bonus health threshold: 10%illusion notes:does not benefit from the bonus magic resistance.modifiers [?]modifier_huskar_berserkers_bloodundispellable after losing his birthright, huskar gained a lethality in physical combat that is only heightened as his own blood is spilled. huskar's model size increases the closer he gets to the max bonuses of berserker's blood, up to 35%. although not visible in the hud due to it not showing enough decimals, each missing point of health grants bonuses. the bonuses grow exponentially, ramping up faster the lower his max health is. the benefits ramp up to approximately 50% of the ability values at 40% max health and 75% of the ability values at 25% max health. stacks multiplicatively with other magic resistance sources. increases huskar's magic resistance up to 32.5%/36.25%/40%/43.75% at 10% max health. while leaping during life break, it can further increases the magic resistance 66%/68%/70%/72%. no bonuses are applied at 100% max health and the maximum bonus values are applied when strictly below 10% max health. the health percentage is checked periodically and the effects are adapted instantly. life break link link rf abilitytarget unit affectsenemies / self damagemagical huskar draws upon his health to break an enemy's life, leaping at a target to shatter a percentage of that hero's current health and slow both their movement and attack speed. while leaping, huskar is debuff immune and has 50% increases magic resistance. cast animation: 0.3+0.5cast range: 550 ( 800)current health as damage: 32%/38%/44% ( 52%/58%/64%)move speed slow: 60%attack speed slow: 60/100/140slow duration: 3/4/5 ( 5/6/7) taunt duration: 3 self affecting componentscurrent health as damage: 32%/38%/44%magic resistance bonus: 50%max debuff immunity duration: 5 16/14/12 ( 11/9/7) 0 aghanim's scepter upgrade: forces the enemy target to attack huskar and increases cast range. spell block / reflection notes:blocked upon impact.the self-damage is prevented as well.modifiers [?]modifier_huskar_life_break_chargedeath modifier_huskar_life_break_slowany modifier_huskar_life_break_tauntdeathno matter the danger, huskar thrusts himself into melees that only he can survive. launches an invisible projectile and periodically drags huskar along with it at a speed of 1200 upon cast. applies a basic dispel on huskar upon cast. huskar receives a hidden charge buff, which lasts for 5 seconds or until reaching the target, whichever is shorter. this modifier grants huskar debuff immunity, magic resistance bonus, disarms him, forces him to face the target, and is responsible for the leap animation. since the modifier has a set max duration, it can expire while leaping, continuing the rest of the leap without its effects. stacks multiplicatively with other magic resistance sources (e.g. berserker's blood). increases huskar's magic resistance up to 62.5% while leaping. with the magic resistance bonus from this source, every 10 points of intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 0.5%. [?] huskar does not need to turn in order to cast targeted abilities or items during the leap. however, the following effects are able to stop the leap: when huskar is disabled during the leap. position change effects (e.g. blink) or affected by other forced movement sources. when the distance between the target and huskar becomes greater than 2440 at any time during the leap. however, the projectile itself does not stop. if re-cast before the projectile reaches the target, life break's effects are still applied on huskar and that target. can be cast on and debuff roshan, but does not damage him. can be cast on couriers. the following effects are applied on the target and huskar upon life break connecting: life break first applies the damage on the target, the damage on huskar, the movement speed slow debuff, then the taunt debuff. deals magical damage to both huskar and the target based on their current health. since the magic resistance bonus is only granted while leaping, the current health as self-damage value is not affected by life break's own magic resistance bonus. the self-damage is not lethal, it cannot be used to deny oneself. huskar is then given an attack order on the target, regardless of auto-attack settings. scepter life break now taunts the target upon cast, forcing them to attack huskar. does not silence the target, so active attack modifiers with autocast on are still applied. has the same taunt priority as berserker's call, little friends and winter's curse, but lower than duel. since the ability upgrade is determined if huskar has aghanim's scepter equipped, the taunt is applied if huskar has the item equipped while being dragged by life break's projectile. soulbind deals 53.76%/61.56%/68.64% of current health as self-damage. huskar ends at the secondary target's location.

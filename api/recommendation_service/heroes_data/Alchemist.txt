spell amplification component to work. while it is not a mountain, razzil has mastered the conversion of smaller compounds to line his pockets. this is innate to alchemist and does not need to be learned. greevil's greed triggers and grants a stack on every last hit alchemist makes on units that have a death gold bounty, except for buildings, illusions, and the tempest double. denies or last hits from his player-controlled units do not add to the current stack. does not trigger on units that have reincarnation as well, except for wraith king skeletons. all stacks work fully independently

drafted as well for the bonus attack damage and bonus spell amplification component to work. this is innate to alchemist, despite chemical rage's in-game ability upgrade tooltip. aghanim's scepter has an active ability for alchemist, allowing him to cast it on ally heroes. treats clones and illusions as creeps. double-tapping aghanim's scepter in the inventory automatically targets self. once cast, the scepter is consumed and the target ally passively receives all of aghanim's scepter's upgrades, as well as the item's attributes: 10 all stats. 175 health and 175 mana. the 4200 net worth of the item transfers from alchemist to the target hero. self-casting does not change the net worth. doing so does not change alchemist's or the target's gpm. a hero can only be targeted once by aghanim's scepter synth. if the target ally bought aghanim's scepter and has it in their inventory or backpack, it gets refunded, removing it and granting them 4200 . if the target ally already has aghanim's blessing or aghanim's blessing - roshan consumed, it gets refunded as well, granting them 5800 . it does not matter how the target acquired aghanim's blessing, the gold is always refunded to the target ally by alchemist, except when targeting himself. gold refunded this way is granted as unreliable gold. the number of stacks and amount of bonuses gained can be seen on the status buff icon. grants the following bonuses to alchemist upon cast on ally heroes: flat bonus attack damage. generic bonus outgoing damage amplification. stacks additively with other sources of generic outgoing damage manipulation. affects only spell damage sourced to alchemist. does not amplify damage flagged as hp removal. since up to 4 allies and alchemist himself can be infused, alchemist can gain up to 125 attack damage and 25% spell damage amplification bonus.

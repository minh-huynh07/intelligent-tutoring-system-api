affects the damage of greater bash. the charge speed is based on spirit breaker's current movement speed, checking his movement speed periodically and adapting immediately. goes on cooldown once the charge ends or is canceled, not upon cast. the player can manually end the charge by giving the hero a stop (s), hold position (h), or any targeted order. other non-targeted abilities do not cancel it, even if they have a cast time. the charge is canceled upon getting stunned, cycloned, hexed, rooted, slept, hidden, feared, hypnotized or by forced movement. it is not canceled by taunts. instead, spirit breaker starts attacking the taunting unit once the charge stops. charge of darkness cannot be manually canceled during taunts. spirit breaker is unable to shift-queue orders with charge of darkness since it is not a channeling ability. shift-queue orders cancels the ability, with the exception of shift-queued patrol commands. however, when charge of darkness ends, spirit breaker is issued an attack order which overwrites shift-queue orders. when auto-attack is set to always, spirit breaker can automatically attack units within attack range, without canceling the charge. during charge of darkness, spirit breaker has phased and unobstructed movement. both the charge indicator above the target, as well as the target buff on the caster are visible to allies only. alt+ left click the status buff announces in the team chat which hero is being charged. charge of darkness doesn't grant caster vision to the target. any unit which comes within 300 radius of spirit breaker during the charge gets hit by greater bash based on its current level. does not affect couriers. greater bash notes fully apply. if it is not leveled, the bash does not occur. a unit may only be bashed once per cast. if an enemy unit enters the radius a second time, they do not get bashed again. the bash radius is offset by 20 units in front of him, so it can hit units 280 range behind and 320 range in front of him. the primary target is bashed upon the charge reaching it, not upon coming within range of the bash radius. a hidden buff is placed upon reaching the target and lasts for 0.1 seconds. the buff is responsible for the greater bash proc. for situations when two targets are charging toward each other, the latter target that casts charge of darkness will apply all its ability effects, following the same notes as above. for how much damage greater bash gains from charge of darkness' speed bonus, please refer to the chart below. if the target dies during the charge, it is transferred to the nearest valid target within 4000 range of the previous target. untargetable units of book of shadows and shadow realm are valid targets. however, it does not change the target to invisible units. the charge exposes the target, revealing their silhouette when they become invisible. also provides shared vision over the target, seeing what they see. shared vision does not work against neutral creeps. destroys trees within 150 radius around spirit breaker whenever the charge ends. scepter can be cast on enemy couriers. spell steal greater bash applied is based on spirit breaker's current ability level when acquired. soulbind charges only to the primary target. charges to the secondary target only when the ability is blocked on the primary target. bulldoze link wd

breaker a universal damage barrier upon cast that absorbs damage values of all damage types (after all reductions), causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity. stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources. universal damage barrier has the lowest priority in the group of damage barriers, its capacity is depleted last when combined with other damage-type barriers. however, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g. refraction), bulldoze does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire. learning the talent does not update the current active instance. greater bash link link et abilitypassive affectsenemies damagemagical gives a chance

whether it procs on attacks, or is applied by spirit breaker's abilities. the bash effects happen before the attack damage of the attack that procs it, and before nether strike's damage. bashed units are knocked back at a speed of 286/304/316/324. also knocks affected enemies 50 units upwards, resulting in a small arc. this has only visual purposes. destroys trees within 100 radius enemies come in

intelligence. planar pocket is an aura, it affects all ally heroes within its radius except for spirit breaker. therefore, unit-targeted abilities targeting spirit breaker still affect him normally. the aura's buff lingers for 0.5 seconds. the unit-targeted ability is blocked, then redirected to spirit breaker while active. for unit-targeted abilities with projectiles (e.g. arcane bolt), they are first blocked, and then recast on spirit breaker. abilities redirected to spirit breaker can still be subjected to other spell reflection sources (e.g. soulbind). planar pocket only redirects abilities cast by heroes. treats illusions as heroes and creep-heroes as creeps. planar pocket's spell block has the following priorities: counterspell echo shield planar pocket planar pocket has the same priority as transfer spellblock and spellblock, which means that the spell gets redirected to spirit breaker, but the linken's sphere procs as well, effectively wasting it. planar pocket's spell

disjoint projectiles upon cast. nether strike places a hidden debuff on the target as soon as spirit breaker begins casting. the debuff is only present during the cast time and disappears once the cast is executed or canceled. exposes the target, revealing their model through the fog of war. also provides true sight over them. instantly moves spirit breaker on the opposite side of the target, 54 range away from it. nether strike applies greater bash based on its current level on the target upon cast. greater bash notes fully apply. if it is not leveled, the bash does not occur. the knockback distance is doubled. bashed units are knocked back 286/304/316/324 distance, over 0.5 seconds, at a speed of 572/608/632/648. a hidden buff is placed upon reaching the target and lasts for 0.1 seconds. the buff is responsible for the greater bash proc. nether strike without greater bash leveled does not interrupt channeling abilities upon cast. nether strike first applies the greater bash debuff, the greater bash damage, and then its own damage. spirit breaker is then issued an attack order on the target. this attack order ignores the auto-attack settings. can be cast on couriers, applying all its effects. nether strike has an increased cast range buffer of 500, instead of using the default 250. this means once the cast animation begins, the target has to move at least 1200 range away from spirit breaker to be considered out of range. the nether strike modifier is responsible for a delay upon successfully casting nether strike, during which spirit breaker is spell immune. however, its duration is set to 0, so it effectively does nothing. spell steal greater bash applied is based on spirit breaker's current ability level when acquired. soulbind affects only the secondary target, when cast on the primary target.

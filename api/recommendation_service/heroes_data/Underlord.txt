seconds. despite the visual effects, the damage is applied instantly, and not upon the waves landing. on each wave, firestorm first applies the damage, then the debuff. does not place the burn debuff on roshan, but does apply the wave damage. the burn debuff deals damage in 1-second (0.75-second) intervals, starting immediately as the debuff is applied, resulting in 3 instances. the burn debuff does not stack per interval. each interval refreshes its duration, resulting in 8 ( 11) possible instances. can deal up to 180/300/420/540 + 12%/16%/20%/24% ( 18.4%/22.4%/26.4%/30.4%) of max health as

targeted area during the cast point are visible and audible to allies only. roots the targets, preventing them from moving and casting certain mobility abilities. fully affects invisible units and units inside the fog of war. provides true sight over the targets. the root is applied periodically to every enemy within the area. however, the hidden modifier prevents them from being continuously rooted for the whole duration. this hidden modifier is applied to every unit within the area which does not have the modifier yet. the modifier lasts for 20/30/40/50 seconds. whenever the modifier expires, enemies get instantly rooted again, and then the hidden modifier is reapplied again. this means that pit of malice does not root every unit within the area in set intervals. each unit is rooted every 20/30/40/50 seconds based on when they entered the area. the hidden modifier does not disappear upon leaving the area. quickly leaving and re-entering does not result in an instant root. all pits share the same modifier, therefore the root does not stack once rooted, the unit becomes immune to all other pits until the modifier wears off. can root a unit up to 4 times if it stays within the area for the full duration, resulting in a total root time of 4.8/5.6/6.4/7.2 ( 17///) seconds. creates a distinct visual effect around, and plays a distinct sound on affected heroes and illusions, but not around other affected units. scepter increases pit of malice radius by 500. acquiring aghanim's scepter immediately updates all current active instances. atrophy aura er abilityaura

showing the current amount of bonus attack damage the aura currently grants. underlord's weapon also glows stronger with green particle effects the more damage stacks he has. talent atrophy aura now grants 50% of the bonus attack damage to all allied heroes, including illusions, clones, and creep-heroes within its radius. however, the bonus attack damage is not provided by an aura, it is placed as an expiring buff on allies. it uses the same modifiers for allies as it does for underlord, so they work exactly the same. affected allies gain 15/17.5/20/22.5 bonus attack damage per dying hero and 1/2/3/4 bonus attack damage per dying non-hero units. fiend's gate link link link rd abilitytarget point affectsallies / enemies opens 2 portals, one next to underlord and one in the target

[?]modifier_underlord_portal_warp_channelany if the channeling is interrupted, the ability does nothing. performing a right click on a fiend's gate causes the hero to begin channeling. the channeling can be initiated by heroes, clones, illusions that can cast abilities, warlock golems, and familiars. other units cannot initiate the teleport, including the spirit bear, and primal split spirits. the channeling can be initiated even while disarmed or silenced. the channeling also does not get interrupted by getting disarmed or silenced during it. while channeling, the unit gets moved towards the fiend's gate until it is within 100 range of it. the pull duration is fixed at 3.5 seconds, so the pull speed depends on the distance upon channel begin. dispelling the modifier stops this movement and removes the particle effects, but the channeling is not canceled. while channeling, the other fiend's gate plays its channeling animation and channelnig sounds as well. upon successfully channeling, the unit gets teleported to the other fiend's gate. does not disjoint projectiles upon teleporting. does not interrupt shift-queue orders upon teleporting. multiple units can channel at the same time, each working independently.

break to it. however, the target's movement speed can still be affected by movement speed bonuses from items and abilities. hex does not apply movement speed slow. therefore, all movement speed increasing and reducing effects are calculated using the 100 base speed. applies generic incoming damage amplification on the hexed target. stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming

shackled target for 2.4/3/3.6/4.2 seconds, even after it is canceled. deals damage in 0.1-second intervals, starting immediately as the channel begins, resulting in 24/30/36/42 ( 34/40/46/52) damage

south, and west. the wards summoned has a fixed 6-second duration, and it is not based on the total channel time. the wards' facing angle is set equal to shadow shaman's facing angle upon cast. the wards are ordered to attack the target upon creation, but they can be controlled by the player following mass serpent wards' notes. all of serpent wards' talents and aghanim's scepter upgrade notes

bidding. places a serpent ward on every 36 th of a 150 radius circle, resulting in 10 wards forming a ring. the wards form a perfect barrier, enemies inside cannot move out unless they have phased movement. destroying one ward is enough to allow units to walk in and out of the ring. the wards' facing angle is set equal to shadow shaman's facing angle upon cast. serpent wards can be controlled to attack a specific target or to stop attacking altogether. serpent wards have a lower target priority than other units and heroes, so they are attacked by towers and creeps last. roshan always prioritizes wards if there are no other units within his attack range. strength of the immortal also instantly destroy serpent wards. treat attacks from towers as heroes, and creep-heroes as creeps. the wards' attack damage is not reduced by damage block. scepter the wards now perform instant attacks on 1 different enemy target within their attack range whenever they launch an attack projectile. an extra projectile is released at the same time together with the primary attack. therefore, it does not matter whether the primary attack misses or not, the extra projectile is still released. the extra projectile travels at the same speed as the primary projectile and can be disjointed like regular attacks. these instant attacks neither proc any attack modifiers nor on-hit effects normally. they do not have true strike and are affected by evasion. the extra attack does not target wards, invisible units, untargetable units, or units inside the fog of war, but they do target buildings. the extra attack has no target priorities. it simply chooses a random valid target within its attack range. acquiring aghanim's scepter instantly upgrades all current existing serpent wards.

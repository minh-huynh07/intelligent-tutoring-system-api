modifier_phantom_assassin_stiflingdagger_casterundispellable modifier_phantom_assassin_stiflingdaggeranythe first skill learned by the sisters of the veil often signals an incoming hit. the stifling dagger travels at a speed of 1200. upon projectile hit, the dagger has a 34% ( 41%) chance to proc the coup de grace buff and causes phantom assassin to perform an instant attack on the target. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally (except tidebringer). they have true strike and completely ignore disarms. cleave effects are based on the target's position, damaging a trapezoid area in the opposite direction where the dagger came from. although the dagger may make it look like a ranged attack, the attack still counts as a melee attack when its coming from phantom assassin. this causes all abilities (and items) that use different values for melee and ranged heroes (e.g. skull basher), to use their melee effects and values, not ranged. if the caster is a ranged hero, the instant attacks do not use attack projectiles and are instant, but still count as ranged attacks. stifling dagger's instant attack first applies the self-total outgoing attack damage multiplier, then grants unique flat bonus attack damage upon the projectile hit. the total attack damage includes all already existing attack damage changes, including conditional bonus sources (e.g. bash and quell). this can be defined as expr atk 30%/45%/60%/75% ( 50%/65%/80%/95%) + 65/70/75/80 applies the bonus attack damage only to the stifling dagger projectile. therefore, attack damage based attack modifiers (e.g. critical strike, lifesteal, cleave) include the 30%/45%/60%/75% instant attack damage bonus as well. since the damage comes from a regular attack, it counts as attack damage and not as spell damage. it is affected by damage block, but unaffected by spell damage amplification and cannot spell lifesteal. the projectile first applies the attack, then its own debuff. the projectile has 450 range flying vision that lingers for 3.34 seconds at the target's location upon successfully hitting it. cannot be cast on couriers. cosmetic has a cast backswing of 0.67 with the exile unveiled equipped. has a cast backswing of 0.8 with the manifold paradox equipped. talent stifling dagger now launches 2 additional projectiles towards random visible valid targets within the range. the search range is based on the cast range and the buffer range, resulting in a search range of 1000/1150/1300/1450. the search range is centered around the primary target, not around phantom assassin, so when no other targets are nearby, nothing happens. the secondary targets are chosen randomly within the area. there are no priorities. the projectiles cannot choose both the same target. since the additional projectiles use the ability's cast range, cast range-increasing effects increase their range as well. phantom strike link wb abilitytarget unit affectsself teleports to a

moves phantom assassin next to the target, towards the position she was upon cast. counterspell does not reflect phantom strike. however, it is still blocked. does not disjoint projectiles upon teleporting. phantom assassin is ordered to attack the target if it is an enemy, automatically canceling the cast backswing. therefore, the cast backswing is only used when cast on ally units. cosmetic has a cast backswing of 0.1 on allies with the exile unveiled equipped. has a cast backswing of 0 with the manifold paradox equipped. cannot be cast on the following units: invulnerable and hidden units. couriers, wards and buildings. blur link link er abilityno target / passive affectsself phantom assassin focuses inward, increasing her ability to evade enemy attacks. can be activated

abilities upon cast. turns phantom assassin invisible with true sight immunity. does not grant phased movement. neither prevents being revealed by chronosphere nor prevents being exposed. despite being revealed or exposed, phantom assassin is still not visible on the minimap. attacking or casting abilities do not break the invisibility. the effect is dispelled when getting within 500 range of an enemy hero, clones and/or an enemy building, including enemy outposts. this includes when the enemy hero is invulnerable and hidden. treat illusions and creep-heroes as creeps. the effect is not dispelled instantly, but 0.5 seconds after getting within range. getting out of range during that delay does not prevent it from dispelling. the delay does not serve as a grace period. the effect is also dispelled when attacking roshan, not instantly, but after the dispel delay. the passive evasion and the active component are independent of each other. evasion uses pseudo-random distribution. stacks diminishingly with other evasion sources. increases phantom assassin's survivability against physical attacks by 25%/43%/67%/100% ( 82%/122%/186%/300%). cosmetic has a cast backswing of 0.8

attack point. when a buff procs, phantom assassin uses a specific attack animation, and particle effects appear on her weapon. neither procs nor critical strikes against allied units, buildings or wards. upon proccing, phantom assassin receives a buff, which grants a critical strike on the next attack. the attack that consumed the buff may also proc another buff instance, making consecutive critical strikes possible. missed attacks do not consume the buff. attacking against allied units, buildings and wards will consume the buff. attacking against items and runes will not comsume the buff. if another source of critical strike procs on the same attack as coup de grace, the crit with the higher multiplier takes priority. coup de grace uses pseudo-random distribution.

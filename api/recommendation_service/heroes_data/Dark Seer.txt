affects invisible enemies within the radius, however, the visual effects do not appear. cannot be cast on couriers. double-tapping automatically targets self. cannot be cast on allies who have disabled help from dark seer. successive casts on the same unit do not stack, but refresh the duration and update the damage to the current level instead. when two opposing heroes cast it on the same target, the modifier updates and start damaging the enemies of the latest caster. however, the modifier status does not update. whether it is treated as a buff or debuff is determined upon the first cast, and is not updated on a refresh. leveling up the ability does not update the current active instances. talent however, the damage increasing talent immediately updates all currently active instances. deals 6/10/14/18 ( 16/20/24/28) damage in 0.2-second intervals, starting 0.2 seconds after the cast, resulting in 105/120/135/150 damage instances. can deal up to 630/1200/1890/2700 (

instances. the max health increasing talent increases the max health of the targeted ally by 250, keeping the current health percentage the same. this counts as setting health. the health increasing talent fully affects the spirit bear, but not other creep-heroes. acquiring the ion shell charges talent instantly grants 1 extra charge. surge link er abilitytarget unit ( target area) affectsallies

landing an attack on an enemy. the bonus damage is applied as spell damage in a separate damage instance, it is affected by spell damage amplification and works with spell lifesteal. constantly checks the distance dark seer moves and calculates the damage, knockback distance, knockback duration, and stun duration accordingly on each server tick. for every 10 distance moved, the damage increases by 4, knockback distance by 2.727, knockback duration by 0.006, and stun duration by 0.012. teleporting effects (e.g. blink) may only add up to 600 range to the distance counter, no matter how big the actual teleported distance was. does not consider upward movement distances. the distance counter never resets, so it is possible to perform multiple full power punches in a row, with cooldown resetting sources. these are the damage, knockback distance, and stun duration values at certain distances moved in the last 3 seconds (before reductions): 0 distance moved: 10 damage, 50 knockback distance, 0.1s knockback duration, 0.2s stun duration. 180 distance moved: 82 damage, 99.09 knockback distance, 0.206s knockback duration, 0.413s stun duration. 360 distance moved: 154 damage, 148.18

punch first applies the stun, the spell damage, the knockback, then the attack damage. if wall of replica is not learned, the illusion deals 80% damage by default. the illusion is spawned 350 range behind the enemy's determined landing position, seconds after normal punch was delivered. the illusion can be controlled normally and is initially ordered to attack the punched target. successive punches can create multiple illusions. the illusion has a expr 2 illusionlvl bounty. treats clones, illusions and the spirit bear as heroes, and creep-heroes as creeps. destroys trees within 100 radius enemies come in contact with during the knockback. the punch particle and sound effects upgrade when the distance counter is at 300, and upgrade again when at 900. cosmetic the invulnerable modifier is responsible for the ability effects upon knocking back an enemy unit. it is only for cosmetic purposes and has no impact on gameplay. wall of replica link rw abilitytarget point / vector

seer, while unable to return to his natural realm, can channel part of the prismatic wall with powerful strength of mind, sowing confusion amongst enemy ranks. wall of replica illusion as they appear to allies and enemies. the values of the wall are set upon cast and do not update upon leveling the ability up after having placed the wall. a wall can only create one illusion per player. there cannot be more than one illusion per player per wall. this means when there are multiple walls up (with multiple casts), every valid enemy unit affected is still limited to one illusion per wall. for enchanted illusions, the wall still cannot create another illusion until the previous one dies. when the illusion dies, wall of replica creates a new illusion of that hero as soon as it comes in range. wall of replica may create illusions from the following sources: from real heroes, it does not create illusions of illusions pathing through the wall. from meepo clones and the tempest double. from the spirit bear. from invisible units, but it does not provide vision or true sight over them. from invulnerable units, but does not apply the movement speed slow on them. from untargetable units. does not create illusions from hidden units, creep-heroes and from wukong's command soldiers. upon spawning, the created illusions are visually distinguishable and are automatically ordered to attack the heroes they are based on. its duration is based on the remaining wall of replica duration from which they originate. they have a static 5 and 5xp bounty which does not scale with levels. the illusion spawns 108-distance from the affected enemy hero if the target's collision size is 27, and 72-distance if its collision size is 18. the created illusion appears either north, east, south, or west from the target. the movement speed slow is applied constantly within the wall's area, provided by an aura. the aura lingers for 1 second. the slow of multiple overlapping walls does not stack.

target in the following conditions: when the target gets out of vision, turns invulnerable or hidden. this includes becoming invisible with true sight immunity. upon the target's death. when it exceeds the 1100 ( 1300) break distance. the effective area for the link break distance is half of a sphere and not a flat circle. therefore, the link can be broken with upward movement sources as well. the link still affects the target and does not break, even when the target(s) run out of mana, enter the fog of war, turns untargetable or invisible. the mana replenished is based on how much the target actually lost per interval. if they have no mana left, no mana is gained either. when lion is at full mana, the enemy target is still damaged and continues to lose mana. grants the

does not drain mana from enemy illusions. treats strong illusion as heroes. shard mana drain now affects 2 additional random enemy targets, prioritizing heroes, within 1050 search radius centered on lion. does not consider units without mana as additional targets. since the additional links use the ability's cast range, cast range increasing effects increase its search range as well. for secondary targets, the link only breaks on the target(s) in the following conditions: when the channeling on the primary target is interrupted in any way. upon the secondary target's death, or upon exceeding the break distance. the secondary links stop draining mana and damaging their target(s), if they enter the fog of war, or when they are affected by invisibility, with or without true sight

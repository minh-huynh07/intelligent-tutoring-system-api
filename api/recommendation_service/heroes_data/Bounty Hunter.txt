the shuriken travels at a speed of 1000. the shuriken first applies the damage, then the debuff, then jinada's spell damage. the initial target does not have to be tracked for the shuriken to bounce. can only bounce to each tracked unit once. can also bounce to different track debuff sources as long as the debuff is applied by an ally. cannot bounce to, but can bounce off of invulnerable or hidden units. can deal up to the following amount of damage (before reductions) to tracked targets per track level: level 1 140/210/280/350 damage. level 2 170/255/340/425 damage. level 3 200/300/400/500

it uses the cast range. gondar's vast experience ensures he never walks away from a transaction empty-handed. upon leveling jinada the first time, it has autocast on by default. despite being an active ability, jinada can trigger while silenced, if set to autocast. jinada's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. however, it is not affected by cast range bonuses. both autocast and manually casting it uses bounty hunter's current attack range. when off cooldown, bounty hunter's weapons emit particle effects. checks its cooldown on attack begin, not on attack hit. this means jinada does not apply when its cooldown finishes during the attack animation. grants regular flat bonus attack damage whenever the ability goes off cooldown, and the bonus is removed when going on cooldown. when attacking any other units, including buildings and wards, only the attack damage bonus is applied, triggering the cooldown. reduces

modifier_beastmaster_axe_stack_counteranywhile learning to maneuver in nature alone, the beastmaster also mastered the use of a pair of tomahawks, adept at cutting down trees as well as adversaries. the axes either travel at a speed of 1200 or reach the target point in 1 second, whichever is faster. the same applies upon returning. upon returning, their speed periodically adapts based on their distance to beastmaster and the remaining travel time. this means the axes fly a maximum of up to 2 seconds, up to 1 second towards the point and up to 1 second back. both axes spread up to 450 distance away from each other, before moving back together while traveling towards the targeted point. their minimum travel distance is 450 as well, so when targeting a point closer than 450 range, they still intersect 450 range away. the axes fly in arcs, so that the axe coming from beastmaster's left hand travels back toward his right hand, and vice versa. they destroy trees within 175 radius they come in contact with, while providing 350 radius flying vision as they travel. this vision does not last. the axes first apply the debuff, then the damage. this means they effectively amplify their own damage as well. uses one debuff on hit targets for all stacks. the debuff has a number on it, showing the number of stacks. since the axes work separately, one of the axes always benefits from 2 stacks of the debuff, if both hit. successive hits on the same unit fully refresh the whole stack's duration. applies generic incoming damage amplification on affected enemy units. stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation. affects all damage types the targets receive from beastmaster, including from all his abilities, and damage from all of his player-controlled units. does not amplify the following damage sources: damage flagged as hp removal. damage sources from allies. each axe can hit the same unit only once per cast, so the maximum possible damage per axe is 37.1/70.2/104.5/140 ( 37.98/71.83/106.88/143.13) before reductions. call of the wild boar link wd abilityno target affectsboar damageinstant kill beastmaster calls forth a

hawk's position, additional casts may accelerate gradually to its position, so that the hawks always fly symmetrically apart from each other, within the same range from the beastmaster. shard therefore, the ability upgrade places both hawks 180 apart each other immediately upon cast. the summoned hawk(s) orbits around beastmaster based on its current movement speed. it cannot be controlled and does not instantly kill previous summons if this ability is used again before the previous summon expires. while beastmaster is moving, the summoned hawk(s) may spiral and accelerate to keep their position symmetrically apart, with each hawk making 6.25 revolutions over the summon's total duration. grants the hawk movement speed bonus based on the distance between it and beastmaster, with its movement speed still capped at . when the hawk is within 280 1500 range away from beastmaster, it has movement speed and gradually decreases until reaching the orbital radius. when the hawk is more than 1500 range away from beastmaster, it is moved along with beastmaster coordinates. therefore, it does not disjoint projectiles upon teleporting. movement speed increasing sources neither affect the orbit radius nor the revolution time. however, movement speed slow sources reduce the hawk orbit radius but do not affect the revolution time. hawk(s) do not block neutral creep camps. hawk(s) casts dive bomb on valid enemy units automatically, prioritizing heroes, within 500 radius. treat clones, illusions and the spirit bear as heroes, and creep-heroes as creeps. with the orbital radius

can be cast on couriers to stun and damage them. they are also affected by the knockback as secondary targets. knocks units aside at a speed of 450, up to 450 range away, resulting in a knockback duration of 1 second. units hit by the knockback destroy trees within 100 radius and are made to face toward the direction they are getting pushed. the knockback and slow have a dynamic range, based on the distance between beastmaster and the primary target. for every 2 distance between beastmaster and the target upon cast, the knockback range increases by 1. for example, when the target is 600 range away, the knockback hits units up to 300 range behind the target and behind beastmaster. the width of the knockback area is fixed at 300, so the affected area is always stadium-shaped. considering the dynamic range, the knockback and slow can hit units up to 900 range away. when an enemy is perfectly aligned with beastmaster and his primal roar target, it does not get knocked aside. however, the slow and damage are still applied, and the target is still disabled for the knockback duration. on the primary target, the roar first applies the debuff, then the damage. on secondary targets, the roar first applies the damage, then the debuff. the movement speed bonus only affects beastmaster and his units. other nearby allies are not buffed. movespeed aura abilityaura affectsself

the interval is not set upon cast. after each cast, the interval updates based on its current attack rate. the reveal modifier is placed on the hawk as soon as it begins casting. the hawk dives in an arc for 0.4 seconds, so the speed varies based on the distance. the speed does not instantly adapt if the distance changes, but rather accelerates or decelerates at a very slow rate. uses forced movement to move the hawk. this means it can be interrupted by applying other sources of forced movement to it. the dive cannot be interrupted by anything else. fully ignores all disables. although

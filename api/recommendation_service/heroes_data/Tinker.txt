reducing the main target's size and current health by 10% (stacking) if it's a hero. the laser bounces once on the farthest target up to 700 range from the primary one, prioritizing heroes. debuff immunity notes:model size reduction pierces debuff immunity.spell block / reflection notes:blocked fully only when primary target.modifiers [?] modifier_tinker_laser_blindanyboush perfected this rock cutting laser in his subterranean laboratory, never considering its combat utility. during the cast time, laser's sound effect is audible and the ability animation is visible to everyone. the area damage only hits visible enemies. does not hit invisible and enemies inside the fog of war. the laser first applies the blind debuff, then the health reduction debuff, then the damage to the primary target. scepter with enough valid targets, it is possible for laser to apply its ability effects in different orders. multiple instances of the debuff do not stack. blind uses pseudo-random distribution. stacks additively with other blind sources up to 100% and multiplicatively with evasion sources. the blind duration treats creep-heroes as creeps. scepter laser now bounces to the furthest enemy within 700 radius of its current target. laser has no bounce delay, so all targets are hit at the same time. can only bounce to heroes, clones, creep-heroes and illusions. if the primary target is a non-hero unit, it still bounces to valid targets within the search radius. does not bounce on invisible or enemies inside in the fog of war. the bounced laser deals its area damage as well. scepter laser also reduces the targets' current and max health by 10%. treats the spirit bear as a hero. treats other creep-heroes and roshan as creeps. the lower the target's current health is, the less current health they lose through the reduction, while the maximum health reduction stays constant. also reduces the target's model size by 10%. this has no impact on collision size. upon losing the debuff, the target's model size and max health are reverted, while their current health stays the same. both the health and the model size reduction are applied by the same modifier as the blind debuff, and multiple instances of the debuff now stack. march of the machines wt abilitytarget point affectsenemy heroes damagemagical enlists an army of robotic minions to destroy enemy units

affected target that absorbs damage values of all damage types (after all reductions), causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity. stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources. universal damage barrier has the lowest priority in the group of damage barriers, its capacity is depleted last when combined with other damage-type barriers. however, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g. borrowed time or refraction), defense matrix does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire. successive casts do not stack but refresh the duration and reset the damage barrier capacity. stacks multiplicatively with other status resistance sources. talent the damage barrier capacity increasing talent does not affect any of the current active instances. the cooldown reduction bonus granting talent stacks multiplicatively with other percentage-based cooldown reduction sources, and is calculated after all flat cooldown reduction values. warp flare link link dd abilitytarget unit affectsenemies damagemagical throws a flare towards an enemy, dealing damage,

modifier_tinker_warp_grenadeanyability draft notes: requires drafting rearm to be unlocked. requires aghanim's shard to be unlocked. the projectile travels at a speed of 1900. warp flare first applies the debuff, the damage, then the teleport. warp flare teleports the target away from tinker upon projectile hit. neither interrupts the affected target's channeling abilities nor changes the target's facing angle. stacks additively with other sources of percentage-based cast range reductions, and is calculated after all flat cast range bonuses. does not reduce any ability's cast range beyond the 150 minimum cast range. percentage-based attack range reduction is calculated after all flat attack range bonuses. soulbind fires a projectile at the primary target after the cast animation, then another projectile is fired instantly on the secondary target. keen conveyance link link fv abilitytarget point / target unit / channeled affectsself teleport to a target friendly structure. level 2

channeling.modifiers [?]modifier_teleportingdeath modifier_teleporting_root_logicdeath modifier_boots_of_travel_incomingdeath ability draft notes: keen conveyance is granted to the player that drafted rearm. as boush likes to say, 'there is nothing the arcane can accomplish that the curious mind cannot reproduce given time. and proper funding, of course.' if the channeling is interrupted, the ability does nothing, and goes into cooldown while consuming mana. double-tapping the ability while being at least 1500 range away from the team's fountain, automatically targets the fountain. when ground-targeted, it automatically searches for the closest valid target for tinker to teleport to. at level 1, keen conveyance can only target buildings. level 2 can target non-hero units as well, and level 3 can target allied heroes as well. treats the spirit bear as a hero. treats other creep-heroes as creeps. cannot directly target buildings. instead, it uses the minimum teleport distance. disjoints projectiles upon teleporting. during the channeling, the teleport destination is marked with a visual effect in the same color as the player, and a sound is played. the sound and visual effects are visible and audible to everyone. the visual effect is also visible while teleporting to invisible allies. also marks the point on the minimap for allies. the mark is in the player's color and lasts as long as the channeling does. provides 200 range flying vision at the destination point for 4.5 seconds, even if the channeling is canceled. the vision lingers for 1 second. the targeted unit's priority is lowered, meaning it is attacked as the last auto-attack target by other units. when the targeted unit dies or changes ownership (e.g. enchant) during the channeling, the teleport gets canceled, wasting the cooldown and mana cost. since buildings are not directly targeted, the destruction of the building or loss of outposts does not cancel the teleport. rearm link link link rr

battery here, another set of rockets there, boush continually improves on existing technology. if the channeling is interrupted, the ability does nothing, and goes into cooldown while consuming mana. the following items' cooldowns are not reset by rearm: aeon disk, arcane boots, black king bar, hand of midas, helm of the dominator, helm of the overlord, linken's sphere, meteor hammer, pipe of insight, refresher orb, refresher shard and neutral items. visually resets the cooldown of tranquil boots, but does not skip the broken state. does not reset charges on charge-based items (e.g. drum of endurance). does not reset the damage mute cooldown of blink dagger-based items. items in the stash, in other units' inventories (e.g. courier) or dropped items are unaffected. allied items in his inventory or backpack do not have their cooldowns reset. can rearm crimson guard and mekansm, but does not reset their stack restriction timer. the same rule applies when rearming mend, however, the ability still restores mana. rearm's sound gets shorter with each level to match the decreasing channel time. the rearm modifier is only for informational purposes. spell steal this ability is not acquirable.

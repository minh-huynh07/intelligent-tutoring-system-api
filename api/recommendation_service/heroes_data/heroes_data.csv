health increases by 9%/14%/19%/25% ( 14%/19%/25%/32%). checks the damage source's current position and compares it to bristleback's facing angle on each damage instance. this means on damage over time effects (e.g. liquid fire), damage of an instance is only reduced when within the reduction angle. damage from death ward, proximity mines is reduced when facing away from them since they are their own source. passive quill sprays based on its current level proc when bristleback's back (not sides) collectively receives 275/250/225/200 damage (after all reductions). passive procs do not interrupt

no-reflection flag (e.g. blade mail). the damage counter has no time limit and only resets once a passive spray occurs. any exceeding damage is accumulated, a single damage instance can trigger

targeting indicator. starbreaker cannot be cast under the following conditions: while the current instance of starbreaker is still active. while not wielding her weapon due to celestial hammer. while channeling solar guardian. double-tapping automatically casts it towards the current facing direction. during starbreaker, dawnbreaker gets moved towards the targeted direction at a set movement speed of 215. the movement is paused by other sources of non-disabling forced movement, but not interrupted. the movement is also paused once dawnbreaker's path is blocked by a cliff, barrier, or other pathing blocker. destroys trees within a 100 radius around dawnbreaker and may pass through buildings during the forced movement. can move dawnbreaker a total distance of 236.5 over 1.1 seconds. shard starbreaker now no longer moves dawnbreaker a fixed distance based on the set movement speed. instead, she has a minimum movement speed of 215 while active, preventing other movement speed slow sources from reducing it lower than the min value. therefore, starbreaker now causes dawnbreaker to path around trees and no longer destroys trees coming in contact. dawnbreaker cannot pass through buildings anymore. with the 25% self move speed slow, the distance moved is now defined as expr ms 0.825, minms = 215 when 215 for the entire duration. with dawnbreaker's base movement speed, it can move her for a minimum of 247.5 distance over 1.1 seconds. during the combo, dawnbreaker is disarmed, and unable to move or turn. items and abilities other than solar guardian and celestial hammer can be cast normally during the combo. with blink, the ability can only be cast in front of dawnbreaker, as casting it in any other direction would require turning. when cast perpendicularly or backward, it will be cast after starbreaker's animation. using mobility items or abilities does not cancel any aspect of starbreaker. starbreaker is canceled if dawnbreaker gets stunned, cycloned, hexed, taunted, feared, or hypnotized during it. however, getting silenced does not cancel it. causes dawnbreaker to perform instant attacks on enemies within the swipe and smash radii. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally, except for cleave. they also have true strike, and completely ignore disarms. luminosity only gains 1 charge per instance, regardless of how many enemies got hit by instant attacks on each instance. performs instant attacks in 0.55-second intervals, starting immediately upon cast, resulting in 3 instances. the effects of the ability are independent of the whirling animation. all enemies are hit at the same time at each interval. fully ignores couriers. the first 2 instances are applied within the 300 swipe radius around dawnbreaker. only these instances slow affected enemies' movement speed. the attacks first apply their damage, then the slow debuff. the last instance is applied within 300 radius and 250 range in front of dawnbreaker. this instance applies the stun with a small 90-range knock-up. the attacks first apply their damage, then the stun/knock-up debuff. the smash can hit units up to 550 range away from dawnbreaker. dawnbreaker gets stunned for 0.2 seconds upon performing the last smash attack of the combo. shard starbreaker now grants dawnbreaker spell immunity while active, but it does not apply dispel. also unlocks dawnbreaker's movement while active, allowing her to move normally, instead of using forced movement. however, her facing angle remains locked, meaning she cannot turn until it is finished. movement orders ignore her facing direction while active so that she can also move backward. other orders like items and abilities still require her to face toward the ordered direction. stops destroying trees around dawnbreaker once upgraded. acquiring aghanim's shard, while starbreaker is active, does not update the current cast. stacks multiplicatively with other magic resistance

impact damage to each enemy. celestial hammer first deals the impact damage, then the fire trail applies the damage per second. the hammer only returns when having the caster modifier. when losing the modifier by dying, the hammer disappears after the pause, instead of returning. the fire trail is created along the path the hammer takes upon returning. it lasts 2.5/3/3.5/4 seconds from the moment it is created. this means the fire created at the starting location disappears earlier than the fire created at the ending location. the fire provides an aura that places a debuff on enemies within

valid targets: heroes, illusions, clones and creep-heroes. if there is no valid target within range, an error message appears and it does not cast. once targeted, the destination is locked, it does not follow the target. while channeling, dawnbreaker cannot act, so she cannot manually cancel the channeling. the channeling can still be canceled normally from disables applied by other units. once the channeling succeeds, dawnbreaker also turns invulnerable, hidden, spell immune, unselectable, and still cannot act. once reaching this state, it cannot be interrupted anymore. dawnbreaker quickly ascents upwards until no longer visible, and stays in the air for the full flight duration. upon reaching the halfway mark of the flight duration, she is teleported towards the center of the

cast range for smashing distant units or remnants. when there are no valid targets near earth spirit or at the targeted point, the ability is not cast. smashing a distant remnant: to do this, the ground must be targeted. there must be a stone remnant within 180 radius around the targeted point. if a remnant is found, he walks towards the point until the remnant is within 180 range. any remnant he meets on the way is ignored. only the closest remnant to the targeted point is smashed. upon reaching the remnant, he smashes it toward the direction he approached it from. smashing a nearby remnant: to do this, the ground must be targeted. there must not be a stone remnant within 180 radius around the targeted point. there must be a stone remnant within 180 radius around earth spirit. boulder smash has a default cast range of 2000. this range allows him to aim the stone remnant precisely. when targeting beyond 2000 range, he walks up until the point is within range. if there is a remnant nearby, he smashes it. smashing a distant unit: to do this, the unit must be directly targeted. there must not be a stone remnant within 180 range of earth spirit. he walks up until the target is within 150 range and smashes it towards the direction he approached the target from. cannot be cast on allies who have disabled help from earth spirit. smashing a nearby unit: to do this, the

the world to its core with tectonic force. fissure's effects are instantly applied within its whole area. there is no travel time. the fissure is created using many segments lined up in front of earthshaker. the amount of segments determines the total effective range of the fissure. the segments have a collision size of 24, and a distance of 8.25 between each other, with the first one being placed 8.25 range in front of earthshaker. this means the actual length of the fissure can only be a factor of 56.25. it is defined as expr(2 * 24 + 8.25) so that it never exceeds the listed values. therefore, fissure consists of 28 ( 32) segments, resulting in an actual range of 1575 ( 1800). every unit, except wards and buildings, within that radius upon cast is pushed aside. the stun and damage are applied in a circular shape around each segment. this means the total damage/stun radius consists of multiple overlapping circles, and not a smooth line. a unit can only be hit by one instance per cast, even when within the damage/stun radius of multiple segments. can hit units up to 1800 ( 2025) range in front and 216.75 range behind earthshaker. fissure first applies the debuff, then the damage. units with flying movement (e.g. arctic burn) or unobstructed movement (e.g. spectral dagger) are not blocked by fissure. they still are fully affected by it otherwise when hit. they are pushed aside, stunned and damaged. non-player-controlled units (i.e. lane creeps) do not try to path around the fissure, but simply walk against it as if it is not there. this effectively causes them to get stuck, until they change directions (e.g. when being aggro'd), or until the fissure dissipates. shard each of the fissure segments now provide a 150 radius aura affecting its caster only, with a 1-second linger duration. the aura grants its caster phase and unobstructed movement, while also allowing the caster to path through fissure. the caster also may path through anything while standing on the fissure and for a short time after leaving its area. for earthshaker, as long as he has the modifier active, he has phased movement and can path through all created fissures, regardless of faction. this is innate to earthshaker. shard fissure also applies aftershock, with a reduced stun duration of 0.5/0.55/0.6/0.65 seconds, based on its current level around each of its segments whenever it gets triggered. a unit can only be hit by one instance of aftershock per cast, even when within the damage and/or stun radius of multiple segments or multiple different fissures.

invulnerable. scepter when ground-targeted, it has no cast point or cast backswing. the leap duration is always 0.8 seconds, so the speed adapts based on the targeted distance. the leap height is always 950 range on the z-axis. during the leap, earthshaker is fully disabled and prevented from acting. while in the air, other units may pass below earthshaker. the ability counts as cast as soon as the leap starts. however, aftershock and the totem buff are applied upon landing. the leap can not be dispelled even when caster is dead. and aftershock will still trigger at the cast location. getting disabled during the leap does not prevent the aftershock and the totem buff from being applied. getting hit by other sources of forced movement causes the leap's trajectory to change, but it is not interrupted. however, it causes the ability to not apply aftershock or the totem buff upon landing. the ability is fully and immediately canceled when being affected by upward movement, teleport, root, and leash sources. the enchant totem buff grants the caster cleave for its duration if the caster's attack range type is melee. cleave damage has the following properties: it counts as spell damage. however, it has the following flags: no-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing its damage from utilizing spell lifesteal. no-spell-amplification flag, preventing its damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification. cleave damage is based on the attack damage value of the cleaving unit, and can be reduced by damage block. the complete cleave area is shaped like an isocseles trapezoid in front of the attacking unit. multiple sources of cleave fully stack and work independently. does not cleave upon attacking wards, buildings or allied units. couriers, wards and

the following flags: no-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing its damage from utilizing spell lifesteal. no-spell-amplification flag, preventing its damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification. cleave damage depends on the attack damage value of the cleaving unit, not on how much their primary attack target took. it is reduced by damage block. the complete cleave area is shaped like an isosceles trapezoid in front of the attacking unit. multiple sources of cleave fully stack and work independently. does not cleave upon attacking wards, buildings or allied units. couriers, wards and buildings are unaffected by cleave. despite the visual effect, the cleave damage is applied instantly in the whole area. the particle effects on hit enemies are visible on

has the highest priority in the group of taunt sources. this means when combined with other taunt sources (e.g. winter's curse), other taunts cannot make dueling units change their attacking targets. both affected duelists can be affected, but cannot be moved by forced movement and fear sources. when affected by fear, the duelist simply does not attack. while dueling, overwhelming odds has an instant cast point and does not require facing the target to cast. only overwhelming odds can be cast, regardless of faction and of disables affecting either duelists. other abilities are still silenced and the items are still muted for both duelists. the duel is nulled in the following conditions: when the distance between the duelists exceeds 2000 at any point during its duration, resulting in no victor. when either duelist is being affected by true sight immunity sources (e.g. depth shroud). when either duelist is brought into supernova or swallowed by dismember. duel ends when the duration of a reflected omnislash or swiftslash ends. when legion commander shatters from ice blast's kill health threshold. when either duelist dies while carrying the aegis of the immortal. when both duelists survive the duel. when any duel is nulled, all other duels involving the duelists are also nulled immediately. the following conditions also do not grant the winner attack damage

is affected by a reincarnation source (excluding aegis of the immortal). if the dying hero if affected by wraith delay and is killed by the opponent instead of the opponent's teammates. if the opponent's teammates land the killing blow on the dying hero under wraith delay, the duel will last until its duration ends, or the opponent dies (in this case, the dying hero gets duel damage). the opponent dies before the duration ends. the opponent is killed or denied by any unit, including neutral creeps and death by self-damage. the winner does not need to be credited for the kill. for clones, the tempest double loses the granted bonus when it dies or expires, while the bonus is granted permanently to the dueled meepo clone. for illusions, the granted stack lasts until the illusion expires. the number of bonus attack damage gained can be seen on the status buff icon and can be seen in its description. if legion commander is victorious based on the aforementioned conditions, a

range of the wall get damaged. if not killed by the damage, the enemy is knocked back towards the arena center. units are not disabled during the knockback. they can still turn, attack, cast

override almost all position changing effects except pulverize. stops enemies without flying movement by slowing them with a movement speed slow aura. the aura has a radius of 750 and is centered on the field. this means units with flying movement can enter and leave the arena freely at any time. the slow gets exponentially stronger towards the walls, which has a 550 radius. this effectively causes enemy units touching the walls to come to halt. the slow is only present when facing toward the walls. units at the walls facing away from it are not slowed. the slow aura's effect lingers for 0.5 seconds, resulting in an effective duration of 5.5/6.5/7.5 seconds. since the slow is fluctuating a lot, it is not displayed in the hud. besides preventing enemies from walking in or out of the area, the following movement abilities are unable to pass the walls either: skewer, sun ray movement, god's rebuke, force staff and hurricane pike. other horizontal movement sources can move units through the walls freely. however, the knockback from inside the arena still triggers and can cancel forced movement. any attack projectile from an enemy gets blocked upon coming within 100 range of the walls. this includes all attack-based projectiles, including those coming from instant attacks. however, it does not block spell-based projectiles (e.g. death ward). these blocked projectiles count as completely negated so that no on-attack effects can trigger (e.g. retaliate). this means ranged enemies outside the arena cannot attack units inside of it and vice versa. melee units can attack freely, if they have enough attack range. projectiles from abilities are completely unaffected as well. provides 550 range flying vision at the center of the area for 5/6/7 seconds upon cast. after the effect delay, trees within 550 range of the wall gets destroyed. this means it effectively destroys trees within a 1100 radius. talent the ally health regeneration talent is provided by an

primal beast forward at a speed of 1200. this affects the following things while charging: primal beast does not need to turn in order to cast targeted abilities or items. can charge through impassable terrain. during the wind-up, onslaught is canceled in the following conditions: either by stun, hex, sleep, fear, taunt sources, or is affected by other forced movement sources. when primal beast turns invulnerable or hidden, or upon death. silence does not cancel the wind-up, but prevents using the begin onslaught sub-ability to start the charge early. however, the charge can still be started early with the previously mentioned orders. stun, taunt and hex sources do not cancel the charge but prevent primal beast from changing directions. additionally, stun pauses onslaught's charge, and primal beast continues charging once the stun duration expires. while charging, onslaught can be canceled in the following conditions: when primal beast is given any targeted order that interrupts channeling abilities, including hold (h) and stop (s) commands. if primal beast gets slept, feared, or is affected by other forced movement sources. when channeling teleport. the max charge distance cannot be increased with cast range bonuses. for better readability, the turn rate is given as degrees per second, instead of radians per 0.03 seconds. during the charge, 50 degrees per

knocked back. does not interrupt allied channeling abilities. units are knocked 200 range away from primal beast over 0.2 seconds. can knock units over impassable terrain. onslaught first applies the

including blink-based abilities as well. does not release pulses upon being moved by force staff and hurricane pike. teleporting effects may only add up to 140 range to the distance counter, no matter how far the actual teleported distance was. this means teleporting a distance of 280 still results in one stomp, and not multiple times based on the entire distance. when primal beast moves or teleport a distance greater than 500 within 0.1 seconds, it does not stomp. considering default movement speed of 310, trample can stomp up to 2.21 times per second. for how many stomps per second primal beast can perform at varying movement speed values, please refer to the chart below. does not perform instant attacks. trample deals regular spell damage within the area. this means they do not trigger any attack modifier or on-hit effects, and ignore evasion. only flat bonus attack damage sources from primal beast can increase the damage dealt. other attack damage bonus sources (e.g. sidekick or percentages bonuses) are not considered. the attack damage as damage value is not capped at 0 attack damage, meaning if primal beast has negative attack damage, trample deals 0 damage per

travel at a speed of 500 and has an effect width of 75. after travelling for 625 distance in 1.25 seconds, the initial damaging line splints from one to two with a 30 angle. the newly splintered lines use the same travel distance and travel speed and do not further splinter. although the total effect radius is 1400, units within certain cone areas might not be damaged. each damaging line cannot hit

kraken shell is procced by an ability that first deals its damage and then applies its debuff (e.g. storm hammer), tidehunter is dispelled before the ability's debuff is applied. kraken shell has an

block is always active and it is independent of the damage threshold for the dispel proc. does not work against damage from wards sources (e.g. death ward etc.). does not reduce physical damage from abilities, except for these abilities. only damage from player-controlled sources (after reductions) is counted towards the debuff removal. the damage threshold counter for proccing the dispel resets

damage is applied when denying allied units. tree grab is a unique attack-based area damage that has the following properties: the area has the following flags: no-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing its damage from utilizing spell lifesteal. no-spell-amplification flag, preventing its damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification. the damage is affected by damage block. it fully stacks with other sources of cleaves, with multiple sources and working independently. applies its area damage upon attacking wards, or buildings, but not on allies and items. wards and buildings are unaffected by the area damage. despite the visual effect, the area damage is applied instantly in the whole area. the area is shaped like a rectangle with a semi-circle on top, and always starts in

away from tiny. the building bonus attack damage is considered as a conditional attack damage bonus. although the attack damage bonus values are not displayed in the hud, it is still considered and directly added to tiny's attack damage. it can be reduced only by flat reductions (e.g. damage block). since it is considered bonus attack damage, it is not affected by percentage-based attack damage

applies splash damage around the target. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. they have true strike and ignore disarms. the splash effects are based on the target's position, damaging a trapezoid area in the opposite direction where the tree came from. if the caster is a ranged hero, the instant attacks do not use attack projectiles and are instant, but still count as ranged attacks. enemies around the primary target are hit by splash damage, instead of instant attacks. the splash damage has the no-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing its damage from utilising spell lifesteal. the splash damage has the no-spell-amplification flag, preventing its damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification. splash damage is affected by damage block. tree throw first applies the slow debuff, then the instant attack and splash damage. although the tree thrown is a projectile and it may look like a ranged attack, the attack still counts as a melee

[?]modifier_undying_decay_buff_counterdeath modifier_undying_decay_buffdeath modifier_undying_decay_debuff_counterdeath modifier_undying_decay_debuffdeaththe strength of the living is simply borrowed from the strength of the dead. successive casts of decay fully stack on the targets and on undying. there is no limit to how much this can be done. decay first steals the strength, then applies its damage. despite the visual effects, the stolen strength is gained instantly. level 1 deals 0 damage to affected units and fully procs on-damage effects (e.g. corrosive skin), except for abilities that have a minimum damage threshold (e.g. gravekeeper's cloak). strength steals cannot reduce a hero's strength below 0, but undying always gains the full amount of strength, no matter how much the target has left. cannot steal strength from illusions, but can temporarily steal from clones. when multiple meepo clones are in the area, one of them, randomly chosen on each cast, gets their strength stolen. the same applies to arc warden and the tempest double. however, the damage still hit all affected targets. reduces the target's current and max health by 88 ( 176), instead of keeping the current health percentage. the lost current health is not returned when the debuff expires on enemy heroes. this means decay effectively deals up to 88/128/168/208 ( 138/178/218/258 or 226/266/306/346) damage (before reductions). can deal up to 0/80/160/240 ( 100/180/260/340) to creeps. treat creep-heroes as creeps. the target also effectively loses 0.36 ( 0.72) health regeneration and 4 ( 8) main attack damage if it is a strength hero. temporarily increases undying's both current and max health, health regeneration, and main attack damage by the same amount per cast. undying does not keep the current health percentage either. this affects the following things: in this example, undying has a current and max health of 520/920 and has one stack of decay buff without the ability upgrade. without accounting for health regeneration values, his current and max health will be increased to 608/1008. with aeon disk equipped after receiving the buff, his current and max health will be increased to 773/1258. this health increase does not count as a heal, so it is unaffected by health-based amplifications and can bypass health freeze sources. each stack places a new hidden modifier buff/debuff on both undying and the target. this means their durations are independent of each other. the counter modifiers on both undying and his targets show how much strength they gained or lost. the number of stolen strength stacks can be seen on the status buff icon. each status buff increases undying's model size by 2%. this has no impact on his collision size. upon death, the dying hero's strength restores back to its normal values, while undying keeps the bonus strength values for the remaining duration. scepter upon acquiring or losing aghanim's scepter, all stacks of stolen strength instantly update to the current values. upon updating the strength values, undying's current health stays the same. however, debuffed enemies keep their current health percentage. their health also only updates upon gaining or losing max health again. soul rip link wr abilitytarget unit affectsenemies / allies(tombstone) damagemagical undying rips health away from all nearby

regardless of unit count. this is not considered as heal. can target enemy tombstone, but does not damage or heal it. cannot cast on undying zombie. the 1300 search radius is always centered on undying, even when targeting other units. units within the radius are selected randomly and have their health set to 15/25/35/45 ( 25/35/45/55) lower than the previous amount. the health cost counts as setting health and is thus never lethal. does not count undying, the target, enemy couriers, wards, buildings, invisible, untargetable enemies and units in the fog of war. spell immune and untargetable allies are counted, including ally couriers and the undying zombies from tombstone. units that require a certain amount of attacks to be killed and familiars do not lose health when counted in by soul rip. if there are no valid units within the search radius, no damage or healing is done. the damage or heal value is dependent on the number of units affected within the radius. it is then summed up and the target receives the total value in one instance. always heals for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much health is set from affected targets. soul rip can damage or heal a unit for up to 150/250/350/450 ( 250/350/450/550) health (before reductions). tombstone link link link et abilitytarget point ( target unit / passive) affectsenemies ( allied heroes)

spawning zombies immediately upon cast, resulting in 8/9/10/11 instances. a player may only have up to 64 zombies under their control, no matter how many tombstones they summon. the zombies and their set target have the following interactions: when the set target turns invisible, the associated zombies die after 0.1 seconds. does not die when set target turns untargetable. when the set target dies, including with reincarnation, the associated zombies die instantly. however, with meepo clones dying, the zombies stand around until the tombstone expires. when the set target turns invulnerable, ethereal, hidden, untargetable, or is affected by the fog of war, the associated zombies will still follow it. when the tombstone expires or is destroyed, all its zombies instantly die.

do not reincarnate when expiring either. these skeletons cannot be controlled. they automatically choose an attack target within 6500 range. if no unit is within that range, they move to the closest lane and walk it down like lane creeps. if their current attack target turns invisible, the skeletons may stop and do nothing. after a while, they select a new target or return to the lanes. the skeletons do not block neutral creep camps. casting wraithfire blast on a target affects the following things: upon its cast point, it orders all skeletons within 2000 radius to attack that target, even when the ability is blocked, reflected, or disjointed. the order lasts for 2 seconds. if the skeletons do not reach the target within the order duration, they automatically search for a new target within 600 radius. successive wraithfire blast casts from the same faction, re-order the skeletons to attack the latest affected target. wraithfire blast casts while the skeletons reincarnate do not order them to attack the target. talent the reincarnation casts wraithfire blast talent also do not order the skeletons to attack the target as well. applies a total damage manipulation on the skeletons' attack damage when attacking buildings and heroes. treat creep-heroes as heroes and illusions as creeps. though this effect is not shown in attack damage hud, but actually stacks additively with other total damage manipulation source (e.g. enfeeble). stacks multiplicatively with other unique incoming damage manipulation sources (e.g. reinforced). therefore, the skeleton's damage dealt

stays dead. wraith king's reincarnation has the highest priority in the group of reincarnation sources. this means when combined with other sources (e.g. aegis of the immortal), this ability will be activated first as long as wraith king has enough mana and the ability is off-cooldown. revives with full health and mana. does not resets the cooldowns of items and abilities. provides 1800 daytime

instantly upon cast, effectively killing himself. when wraith king is invulnerable or hidden, he is unable to cast abilities on himself, hence being unable to double-tapping to activate reincarnation. the movement speed slow is applied on enemy heroes and clones upon triggering reincarnation. treat illusions and creep-heroes as creeps. 1/2/3 ( 3/4/5) wraith king skeletons are also summoned for each enemy hero within 900 radius upon triggering reincarnation. skeleton notes of vampiric spirit fully apply. if it is not learned, no skeletons are summoned. treats clones as heroes, illusions and creep-heroes as creeps. the skeletons are also summoned for enemies inside the fog of war and invisible units. scepter reincarnation now provides another radius aura and its buff lingers for 0.5

dead. scepter wraith delay's 7-second duration triggers when the hero reaches 1 health. units in wraith form are kept alive by having their minimum health set to 1. damage taken is technically not reduced. does not trigger in the following circumstances: if the target is affected by shallow grave, battle trance, or have other reincarnation sources. if the target is an illusion, despite the aura

due to either the prime or any one of its clones dying, including being denied, during the wraith delay. scepter grants the affected heroes phased and unobstructed movement, allowing them to move through units and trees and impassable terrain. wraith form causes the hero's model size to increase by 25% for its duration. this has no impact on its collision size. it also increases movement speed by 25% and attack speed by 75 for the duration. allies in wraith form can act freely like regular heroes, and can still be interacted normally, without any restrictions. this means they still are fully affected by attacks and abilities normally, and already existing buffs and debuffs continue to affect them. during wraith delay, the hero's health bar is visible to allies only. scepter when the wraith delay duration ends, the hero dies. the kill is credited to whoever put the hero in wraith form. this death cannot be prevented in any way. it ignores invulnerability and everything that would typically prevent death. if the hero has reincarnation sources, it triggers normally once the hero dies. affected ally heroes have their respawn time reduced by 10% as shown at the chart below. talent

blessing and aghanim's shard are copied as well. however, other permanent modifiers (e.g. duel, intelligence steal) are not. any permanent modifiers gained by the tempest double while alive are lost once it gets resummoned. abilities that grant effects for killing heroes (e.g. flesh heap, track, etc.) do not do so when the tempest double is killed. the double is a clone and therefore treated exactly like a hero by all abilities since it is not an illusion. the double has a 180/240/300 and a 180/240/300xp bounty. the gold is granted to the killing player, and the experience is distributed like any other experience. however, if the double is killed by creeps or buildings, the gold gets distributed as well, just like hero kills do when not killed by players. the tempest double does not passively gain any experience like heroes usually do, so it does not leech experience from its allies. any experience the double would have gained (e.g. via transmute) is transferred to arc warden, even if the tempest double was dead at the time. other ultimate abilities are also always inactive if the tempest double attempts to copy them (e.g. in custom games). spell steal creates a double based on rubick's model, that has all rubick's basic abilities, with spell steal inactive, and without the other acquired abilities. losing and reacquiring the ability allows rubick to summon another double from the previous steal. tempest abilityinnate affectsthe self the upheaval has attuned arc warden to the ancients. notes this is innate to arc warden and does not need to be learned. when the hero's faction is the radiant, the zet will have its regular abilities, while its tempest double will have the tempest component's ability traits and values as alternatives. when the hero's faction is the dire, the zet will have the tempest component's ability traits and values by default, while its tempest double will retain the original ability traits and values.","tango,faerie fire,healing

of 2000, reaching max distance in 0.45 seconds. the knockback distance is based on the distance between drow ranger and the affected enemies. the closer they are, the further they get knocked back. the knockback is strongest when the distance between drow ranger and the enemy is 1 range, pushing the enemy 450 range away. each additional range of distance between them affects the knockback's distance, reducing it by 0.5. however, the knockback values are truncated, so that the knockback distance decreases by 1 for every 2 2 range between drow and the enemy. due to this, the minimum knockback distance is 1 range. when standing at the exact same location as drow ranger, the formula multiplies by 0, which results in no knockback. since the knockback distances do not scale with higher ability levels, but the knockback duration does, the knockback speed gets lower on each level. this results in a maximum knockback speed is 750/642.86/562.5/500, while the minimum speed is

a distracting frivolity. in the war of the ancients, such technique has become strange necessity. the arrows fly at a speed of 1200, and fly either the full distance or until hitting an enemy. the speed is not affected by projectile speed increasing effects. the first wave starts 0.1 seconds after the channel begins. then it releases the waves in a 0.55 ( 0.4125)-second intervals. within the waves, the arrows are released with a 0.033-second delay between them, so it takes 0.1 ( 0.13) seconds for all arrows of one wave to be released. this results in a total duration of 1.3 ( 1.03) ( 1.33, 1.06) seconds to release all arrows, making it safe to cancel the last 0.45 ( 0.72) ( 0.42, 0.69) seconds of the channeling without losing an arrow. talent the multishot waves increasing talent does not reduce the max channel time, therefore it reduces the wave release intervals. the arrows are released in a cone centered in front of drow ranger. the first arrow in each wave always starts on drow ranger's right side. the cone's angle is calculated as if 6 arrows get released per wave. if 6 arrows would get released, the cone's angle would be 50 . however, since only 4 ( 5) arrows get released, the cone's angle is 33.33 ( 41.67 ), with an angle of 8.33 between each arrow. considering drow ranger's default attack range of 625 ( 825), the cone has a length of 1094 ( 1444), and an end radius of 358.5 ( 586.82). the travel distance can be further increased by other attack range bonuses. shard while on the glacier, multishot travels further and fires an extra arrow per cast. the arrows provide 100 radius flying vision around them as they travel. an enemy may only be hit one arrow per wave, so that up to 3 ( 4) arrows can hit the same enemy per cast. each of multishot's arrow deals spell damage based on drow ranger's current main attack damage, plus the current frost arrows' damage values. other attack damage bonuses are ignored. checks drow ranger's main attack damage periodically and adapts the spell damage instantly. the arrows neither procs any attack modifier nor trigger any on-attack effects, but are affected by spell damage amplification and spell lifesteal.

affects frost arrows damage, but not the damage dealt by the hypothermia projectiles. the arrow's damage is then dealt in one instance together with all of its effects. the arrows also apply frost arrows based on its current level while drow ranger is still channeling multishot as the arrows are airborne. if frost arrows is not leveled, its damage and debuffs are not applied. frost arrows applied by multishot do not cost any mana, are applied even if the ability itself is currently not castable, and regardless of its autocast status. the arrows stop applying frost arrows if the channeling is interrupted, or when the arrows are still airborne while the channeling finishes. however, toggling on autocast ensures that all multishot arrows will apply frost arrows's debuff. does

regardless of how many remnants he is traveling to with a single cast. always travels to the fire remnant furthest away from the targeted point first. while traveling, ember spirit cannot turn but can attack, cast abilities, and use items. using items still requires ember spirit to face his targets. therefore, while traveling, fire remnant does not require facing the target to cast. other forced

type as the caster, as well as cast range bonuses. with the ability's own attack range bonus, acorn shot effectively has a cast range of 700/775/850/925 on hoodwink. cast range bonus from scurry does not apply to acorn shot. however, attack range bonus from scurry applies. level 4 acorn shot with activated scurry has a cast range of 975/1025/1075/1125. when ground-targeted, a tree gets planted upon reaching that point. planted trees have a smaller collision size and block less vision than regular trees. unlike with other planted trees, tango does not heal for twice as long when targeting an acorn shot tree. the planted tree provides 200 radius ground vision around itself, which lasts for 20 seconds or until the tree is destroyed. when put on alt-cast, the ability can only be ground-targeted. when unit-targeted, the initial hit is not counted towards the bounce limit, so that up to 3/4/5/6 ( 5/6/7/8) hits can be achieved. the initial projectile travels at a speed of 2200. the speed while bouncing can be defined as expr attackprojectilespeed 0.5. this affects acorn shot not being able to be reflected on certain melee heroes (e.g. marci) because they have 0 projectile speed. with hoodwink's default attack projectile speed, the bouncing projectile travels at a speed of 900. the projectile speed can be further increased by other attack projectile speed bonuses. the projectile bounces in 0.1-second intervals. can bounce on the same unit multiple times, but only when another target was hit between the bounces. can bounce on units in the fog of war. can bounce on attack immune units. cannot bounce on invisible, invulnerable or hidden units. upon projectile hit, acorn shot causes hoodwink to perform an instant attack on the enemies. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. they do not have true strike, but completely ignore disarms. for melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss. acorn shot's instant attack first applies the self-total outgoing attack damage multiplier, then grants unique flat bonus attack damage upon the projectile hit. the total attack damage includes all already existing attack damage changes, including conditional bonus sources (e.g. bash and quell). this can be defined as expr atk 75% + 55/90/125/160 applies the bonus attack damage only to the acorn shot projectile. therefore, attack damage based attack modifiers (e.g. critical strike and lifesteal) include the 75% bonus damage as well. since the damage comes from a regular attack, it counts as attack damage and not as spell damage. it is affected by damage block, but unaffected by spell damage amplification and cannot spell lifesteal. when ground-targeted, the instant attack of acorn shot does not break the invisibility of the following sources: decoy, disguise and glimmer. for fade, the invisibility breaks upon projectile hit after the fade time. for shadow walk and shadow walk, the invisibility breaks upon projectile hit and applies its ability effects. the projectile performs the instant attack, then applies the debuff. the movement speed slow

faster. the same applies upon returning. this means the boomerang can fly for 1 2.4 seconds at minimum and maximum respectively. the duration is set once upon cast, based on the distances. if the distances change after cast, the speed adapts to the predetermined duration. for example, if the target was within 450 range upon cast, the boomerang will have fully returned within 1 second. if the target was more than 1080 range away, it will have fully returned within 2.4 seconds. when ground-targeted, it flies towards that point at the fixed speed of 900. the boomerang is always thrown from

sharpshooter. non-targeted abilities and items are used normally. however, targeted items that require facing can only be cast when targeted within her current facing direction. targeting outside her

when there is only a single target. despite the description, it neither launches moon glaives upon cast nor relies on moon glaves to be leveled to launch the instant attacks. the instant attacks originate from the targeted point or unit, they can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally (including moon glaives). they do not have true strike, but ignore disarms. the attacks do not

enemy numbers. if the leading attack misses, moon glaives do not bounce. the bouncing glaives travel at the same speed as the leading attack's projectile and can be further increased by attack projectile speed bonuses. with luna's default attack projectile speed, the bouncing projectiles travel at a speed of 900. despite its identical appearance to luna's normal attack, the bouncing projectile deals physical spell damage. they are not instant attacks. these projectiles also neither trigger any attack modifier nor on-hit effects. evasion has no effect on them. does bounce to but does not damage ethereal units. the spell damage value is based on the attack damage value calculated for the leading attack during its attack point. it has the following flags: no-spell-lifesteal

taken (after reductions) by the target. not affected by other conditional attack damage bonuses (e.g. pierce) as well. however, the damage value fully works with critical strike and quell sources,

glaives, with the passive effects still present. upon cast, 4 glaives spawn from the center of luna, logarithmically spiraling out in 1.2 seconds until reaching the orbit of revolution. the glaives deal damage upon cast, then orbits in a 175 radius centered around luna at a speed of 160, and are centered on luna for the full duration. the glaives are phased and are invulnerable units that self-rotates in 0.133 seconds per revolution. the glaives can be seen even when luna is invisible or in the fog of war. luna performs instant attacks on hit enemies within 115 radius of the orbiting glaives. although the glaives are performing the instant attacks, the damage is sourced to luna. these instant attacks neither proc any attack modifiers, nor on-hit effects. they have true strike, but completely ignore disarms. for melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss. successive casts refresh its active duration, but do not

bestowed her with impressive defensive powers. this is innate to medusa and does not need to be learned. this ability can be upgraded up to level 5. medusa's mana bar is visible to everyone. mana shield has the highest priority in the group of damage manipulation effects. mana shield first reduces incoming damage (before reductions), then the damage instance is applied while her current mana is drained. as long as medusa has mana, mana shield precedes armor, magic resistance, damage block, damage barrier and damage negating sources (e.g. aphotic shield). this also affects everything which works directly with damage dealt after reductions (e.g. soul burn). applies 98% ( 100%) unique incoming damage reduction on medusa. stacks multiplicatively with all other sources of incoming damage manipulation. affects all damage types medusa receive, including damage flagged as hp removal. the health cost of casting abilities such as soul ring is also reduced. however, it does not reduce inflicted health cost (e.g. armlet of mordiggian, soul rip). increases medusa's effective health by 1.96/2.352/2.744/3.136/3.528 ( 3.63/4.02/4.41/4.8/5.19) per point of mana, assuming she has enough mana. in other words, for each 100 damage taken, medusa loses 2 health and 49/40.83/35/30.63/27.22 ( 26.49/23.9/21.78/20/18.49) mana. for medusa's illusions, they lose the following amount of mana per

modifier_medusa_stone_gaze_stonestrongthe beauty of medusa is legendary. stone gaze's angle visualised. the enemy team must have vision over medusa, while she is using stone gaze, for at least 1 server tick before the ability starts affecting any enemies. stone gaze will affect no enemies at all until this is achieved. once this is achieved, enemies that break the vision of medusa can still be affected by stone gaze, even through the fog of war. every enemy unit that faces medusa within 85 in front of them within a 1200 radius around medusa gets the facing and the slow debuff applied. the facing debuff counts for how long the unit faces medusa. if it accumulates 2 seconds of facing time, it petrifies the unit. the facing debuff lasts for either as long as stone gaze does (or ending whenever stone gaze ends in any way), or until getting petrified. looking away from medusa does not reset the 2-second facing counter. facing medusa while invulnerable or hidden still counts towards the 2-second counter. this means that petrification can be avoided by being invulnerable as the ability attempts to petrify. the slow debuff only slows affected enemies while facing medusa. units that turn away are not slowed but keep the debuff. the slow debuff lasts for either as long as stone gaze does (ending whenever stone gaze ends in any way), or until getting petrified. once the petrify debuff expires, the unit can be affected by stone gaze again, repeating until stone gaze ends, so long the unit faces medusa. the petrify debuff is a stun that also freezes animations. the same debuff applies a unique incoming damage amplification on affected enemies. stacks multiplicatively with all other sources of incoming damage manipulation. amplifies all physical damage, including spell damage (e.g. quill spray}), the affected enemy targets receive. does not amplify the magical or pure damage sources of any kind. does not affect neutral creeps. stone gaze ends when medusa dies, but already petrified enemies stay petrified for the duration.","ring of basilius,ring of basilius,iron branches,enchanted mango,power treads,wraith band,magic wand,butterfly,manta style,hurricane

cooldown, monkey king is disarmed and unable to move while perched on a tree, preventing him from attacking and unperching. forced movement, cyclone and teleport sources (e.g. blink dagger-based items) unperches monkey king as well. while on a tree, tree dance can be cast again, targeting another nearby tree. all trees within cast range are highlighted with a white glow. monkey king cannot cast tree dance on the tree he is perching on. monkey king only gets stunned if the tree he perches on is destroyed. getting unperched in other ways (e.g. forced movement) does not result in a stun. the unperch stun is applied even when monkey king is debuff immune, invulnerable or hidden, and its stun duration is not affected by status resistance. spell steal primal spring and the spring early

of 192. during the leap, other units may pass below monkey king. the activity modifier only appears during the leap and is responsible for the leaping animation. when targeting beyond the max leap distance, monkey king leaps for the max distance towards the targeted point. the damage and movement speed slow values are based on the time spent channeling, meaning their potency increases per each

formations. total size of all 3 rings. upon cast, 14 ( 21) clones of monkey king spawn which immediately walk to their determined spot in the formation. they walk at a speed of 700 and have unobstructed movement. the formation they take is always the same except when space is limited by the edges of the map. a diagram on the right shows the soldier's formation on each ring. the first ring soldiers form a pentagon within a 300 radius circle, with the tip always facing north. the second ring soldiers form a nonagon within a 750 radius circle, with the tip always facing north as well. talent the third ring soldiers form a heptagon within a 1100 radius circle, with the tip always facing north as well. the soldiers have phased movement, are invulnerable and considered hidden (although visible), making them immune to almost every ability. they are uncontrollable, unselectable, and can neither pick up nor drop any items. they copy most of monkey king's items, and can use attack modifiers and bestow auras he had upon cast. the soldiers are hero clones of monkey king, copying all attributes of monkey king, with some special exceptions. they are not illusions. their base stats and attributes adapt whenever summoned (e.g. permanent attribute loss from glaives of wisdom or essence shift). while the clones can be affected by attack speed buffs and slows, they may only attack once per 1.2 seconds, even if their attack misses. however, the soldiers are fully affected by attack animation bonus sources. their daytime and nighttime vision is set to 600. they provide the vision while walking to their spot and while standing there. the soldiers only attack enemy heroes, clones, creep-heroes and illusions they see inside wukong's command. invisible enemies and enemies inside the fog of war within the circles are not attacked. other units and any unit outside the circle are fully ignored, even when within attack range of a soldier. since the soldiers use regular attacks, their damage is reduced by damage block. the buffs of a consumed aghanim's blessing and aghanim's shard are copied as well. however, other permanent buffs (e.g. moon shard or duel) are not copied. if monkey king moves more than 780 ( 1130) range away from the center of the circle, or when he dies, the soldiers disappear and the ability ends. successive casts immediately end the current instance while active. when monkey king dies, the soldiers immediately disappear. jingu mastery does not work for the clones. they neither can add stacks on enemies, nor gain the buff if monkey king had it upon cast. scepter this restriction is now removed upon acquiring aghanim's scepter. it now works for the clones, although slightly different. instead of placing a debuff on their attack target to count attacks, the clones themselves gain the counter instead. this means jingu mastery works independently for each clone and does not interfere with monkey king's current stacks. clones treat creep-heroes as creeps. scepter the passive soldiers' spawn uses a fixed replenish time instead of a spawn interval. the charge replenish timer counts even without having aghanim's scepter. this means a soldier will immediately spawn upon acquiring the item. upon replenishing a charge, but monkey king's condition does not allow passive spawns, wukong's command spawns the soldier as soon as the circumstances allow it to. the passive soldiers do not spawn in the following conditions: while monkey king is affected by the tree dance bounce leap and bounce perch modifiers. while disguised with mischief. while monkey king is fully invisible, hidden or dead. the fixed replenish time is not affected by any cooldown reduction sources. passively spawned soldiers can attack any unit, except roshan. the passive soldiers only attack buildings when monkey king is within 500 range of them. however, the buildings attacking restriction is not applied to ranged heroes. talent the additional wukong's command ring also increases the cast range of this ability. spell steal grants jingu mastery despite not showing in any of the stolen ability slots. this ability's cast point is also not

neither replaces morphling with a clone nor an illusion of the target. morph only copies the target's model, hitbox, including equipped cosmetic items. the combat log still registers the copied model as morphling. morphling can still be killed normally in the morphed form. morph neither acquires innate abilities nor other innate ability traits (e.g. freely moving in the chronosphere), except the following abilities: stone remnant, mana shield and stone form. while active, morphling is visually distinguishable from the original hero. neither dispels buff and debuffs upon cast and casting the morph replicate sub-ability. keeps the current health and mana percentages upon cast. morph does not copy the target's current health or mana. the affected target's hero icon is displayed as a debuff on the hud. changes morphling's current base attribute values and primary attribute from agility to the affected target's values. bonus attributes from abilities and items are not copied. changes morphling's attack range type from ranged to the affected target's attack range type. this causes items that use different values for melee and ranged heroes (e.g. manta style) to now adapt to morphling accordingly. attack range-increasing sources are not overridden and still work normally. fully copies the target's movement speed. this means when targeting a melee strength hero, morphling becomes a melee strength hero for the duration. all other base stats of the affected target (e.g. attack damage values, armor, magic resistance, base attack time, collision size, etc.) are not copied. does not copy the target's transformed state as well (e.g. elder dragon form). items are not copied as well. most channeling abilities are interrupted upon unmorphing, except for phase shift, upheaval, and casting item abilities. treat clones and illusions as heroes, creep-heroes and the spirit bear as creeps. casting on illusions is considered as casting morph on the hero who owns the illusion. therefore, morph copies the hero who owns the illusion and not the hero the illusion is based on. casting ability on an illusion based on a dead hero does nothing. for example, when targeting disruption illusions, morphling turns into shadow demon, and not the hero disruption was cast on. however, it cannot target morphling itself or illusions under morphling's control. an enchanted morphling illusion is still treated as its own illusion and can still not be targeted. scepter upon acquiring the ability upgrade, it has alt-cast activated by default. with alt-cast activated, morph creates a strong illusion of the affected target that can cast all of the target's basic abilities, but not ultimate and item abilities. the morph illusion spawns with full health and faces the same angle as the affected target. the morph illusion neither has a gold nor an experience bounty. the distance between the morphling and the morph illusion is always one-fourth of the distance between morphling and the target. scepter the morphed illusion acquire innate abilities and other innate ability traits. however, it cannot acquire invoked and devoured abilities. the ability cooldown of the acquired basic abilities is shared between morphling and the morph illusion. however, it does not share the charges of charge-based abilities. therefore, morphling and the morph illusion both have independent charges for charged-based abilities. when losing the ability upgrade, the morph illusion is not instantly killed, and the morph replicate sub-ability can still teleport morphling to its place. however, casting morph no longer shifts morphling back into the affected target. spell steal this ability is not acquirable. spell steal cannot acquire any abilities from the

morph. instead, it shifts morphling back to his original form. when used again, it shifts morphling back into the target. goes on cooldown whenever forms get shifted. scepter casting the sub-ability

abilities, then it removes morphling's abilities and replaces them with the affected target's basic abilities, including their passive abilities and sub-abilities. therefore, morphling has to cast morph replicate twice to update all copied abilities and their values. this affects the following things: invoked abilities. new basic abilities acquired via spell steal upon morphing into them. new devoured abilities. non-ultimate abilities granted by aghanim's scepter and aghanim's shard are only copied if both morphling and the affected target have the respective item as well. does not copy

often signals an incoming hit. the stifling dagger travels at a speed of 1200. upon projectile hit, the dagger has a 34% ( 41%) chance to proc the coup de grace buff and causes phantom assassin to perform an instant attack on the target. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally (except tidebringer). they have true strike and completely ignore disarms. cleave effects are based on the target's position, damaging a trapezoid area in the opposite direction where the dagger came from. although the dagger may make it look like a ranged attack, the attack still counts as a melee attack when its coming from phantom assassin. this causes all abilities (and items) that use different values for melee and ranged heroes (e.g. skull basher), to use their melee effects and values, not ranged. if the caster is a ranged hero, the instant attacks do not use attack projectiles and are instant, but still count as ranged attacks. stifling dagger's instant attack first applies the self-total outgoing attack damage multiplier, then grants unique flat bonus attack damage upon the projectile hit. the total attack damage includes all already existing attack damage changes, including conditional bonus sources (e.g. bash and quell). this can be defined as expr atk 30%/45%/60%/75% ( 50%/65%/80%/95%) + 65/70/75/80 applies the bonus attack damage only to the stifling dagger projectile. therefore, attack damage based attack modifiers (e.g. critical strike, lifesteal, cleave) include the 30%/45%/60%/75% instant attack damage bonus as well. since the damage comes from a regular attack, it counts as attack damage and not as spell damage. it is affected by damage block, but unaffected by spell damage amplification and cannot spell lifesteal. the projectile first applies the attack, then its own debuff. the projectile has 450 range flying vision that lingers for 3.34 seconds at the target's location upon successfully hitting it. cannot be cast on couriers. cosmetic has a cast backswing of 0.67 with the exile unveiled equipped. has a cast backswing of 0.8 with the manifold paradox equipped. talent stifling dagger now launches 2 additional projectiles towards random visible valid targets within the range. the search range is based on the cast range and the buffer range, resulting in a search range of 1000/1150/1300/1450. the search range is centered around the primary target, not around phantom assassin, so when no other targets are nearby, nothing happens. the secondary targets are chosen randomly within the area. there are no priorities. the projectiles cannot choose both the same target. since the additional projectiles use the ability's cast range, cast range-increasing effects increase their range as well. phantom

illusions that were moving or attacking a target continue to move or attack their target after reappearing. destroys trees within 150 radius of phantom lancer and every affected illusion upon

except allied units. disarm or ethereal effects on phantom lancer do not prevent him from rushing. however, attack immune units (e.g. invulnerable, ethereal) cannot be targeted. upon triggering, phantom lancer receives the rush buff, which grants haste and phased movement. this buff lasts for up to 5 seconds, until phantom lancer successfully hits the rush target, or until he receives another order. non-targeted items do not cancel the rush. double-tapping item abilities count as self-targeting and therefore cancel the rush. the rush buff is also lost when phantom lancer gets stunned, cycloned, slept, hexed or hidden. roots do not cause phantom lancer to lose the buff, and he continues rushing once the effect expires. taunts cause phantom lancer to rush towards the taunting unit instead, without making him lose the buff. forced attacks caused by taunts do not make him lose it either. fear does not make him lose the buff either so he flees with the rush speed. when the target turns hidden, invisible, or moves into the fog of war, phantom lancer rushes towards the unit's last known location. phantom lancer gains the agility buff as soon as he loses the rush buff. it does not matter how he loses the rush buff, the agility buff is always gained. therefore, if the distance between phantom lancer and his target is less than the min proc distance, phantom lancer will

and cooldown are for the ability upgrade. the chance to spawn illusions only triggers upon attacking, including instant attacks. works against attacking wards, but not buildings. juxtapose uses pseudo-random distribution. illusions created by juxtapose attack the target that the ability was triggered upon. this means that illusions created by juxtapose use phantom rush when their target is in the correct range. illusions created by juxtapose have a static 5 and 5xp bounty which does not scale with levels. the illusion spawns 72 range away from phantom lancer, appearing either north, east, south, or west from him. juxtapose works for all illusions that have this passive ability, no matter the owner or illusion creator, it is not exclusive only to phantom lancer's abilities. this includes illusions created with items (e.g. manta style) or with other abilities (e.g. reflection). this means that even enemy illusions of phantom lancer have a chance to spawn new ones for the owner of the illusion. shard adds an active component to juxtapose with the passive effects still present. the invisibility buff duration and illusion duration are independent of each other. the illusion created automatically walks forward in the direction phantom lancer was facing upon cast for 4 seconds. shard the invisibility buff is lost upon reaching the cast point of abilities or items, or upon landing an attack. missed attacks do not break it. grants phased movement while fully invisible and allows phantom lancer to path through other units, including wards, but not through buildings. phantom lancer can pick up, drop, or attack items without breaking the invisibility. successive casts refresh the invisibility duration.","tango,healing salve,enchanted mango,iron branch,magic

radius, the storm chooses between them randomly on each strike. the strikes are neither regular attacks nor instant attacks, so they fully ignore effects such as evasion and damage block sources. this also means that they cannot trigger on-attack effects (i.e. counter helix or break enemy's tranquil boots). however, it is considered as spell damage, it is affected by spell damage amplification and works with spell lifesteal. the strikes first apply the armor reduction, then the damage. the armor reduction debuff on units lasts as long as the storm, or until razor dies. successive casts create

smoke screen applies both a buff to allies and a debuff to enemies, such that enemies affected by the debuff have a chance to miss attacks regardless of the location of the target, and allies affected by the buff have a chance to evade attacks regardless of the location of the attacker. debuff immunity suppresses the effects of the debuff, but does not prevent missing on targets affected by the buff. the buff also grants riki assists when ally heroes get kills while affected by it. successive casts do not update the current ability values but refresh its duration. however, smoke screen of

range in front of him. places one hidden debuff on the enemy. this debuff counts how many shadowrazes hit the target within its duration. shadowraze first sets its damage based on current stacks, then applies the debuff or increases the stack count, then deals the damage, and then the instant attack. this means the first stack added by the raze does not affect the ability's damage. a number on the icon shows how many times the debuff was refreshed, including the first cast. the debuff has no stack limit and can be increased infinitely. hitting all 3 shadowrazes consecutively can deal up to 370/600/830/1060 damage to a single unit (before reductions) and applies up to 24%/26%/28%/30% movement speed slow. with the base damage increasing talent, they can deal up to 715/945/1175/1405 damage. with the stack damage increasing talent, they can deal up to 420/650/880/1110 damage. with both talents, they can deal up to 765/995/1225/1455 damage. the hidden debuff is placed on heroes and is used to count successive shadowraze hits. it lasts for 3 seconds. although only the demon eater cosmetic item makes use of it, the counter is always placed. talent with the shadowraze using attack damage talent, shadowraze causes shadow fiend to perform an instant attack on all hit enemies within its effect radius. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers, including necromastery, and

100/125/150/175) regular flat bonus attack damage with the maximum amount of souls. these extra souls affect the number of lines created by requiem of souls. when losing the ability upgrade, the attack damage bonus adapts immediately and does not account for the extra souls. shadow fiend keeps his stacks even when having more than the default allowed amount. however, requiem of souls still releases more lines in this case. shard necromastery turns into an active attack modifier, with the passive components still present. necromastery's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. it is not affected by cast range bonuses. both autocast and manually casting it uses shadow fiend's current attack range. shard upon cast, the attack projectile is replaced with a thicker particle. the necromastery attack fears the target, and has an ensured critical strike, crits with a lower value have no effect if they proc since the higher crit value takes priority. the attack, including instant attacks (e.g. shadowraze), first applies the fear debuff, then its own damage. necromastery's fear makes affected enemies run away from the caster, rather than make them run toward their team's fountain. consumes a stack and goes on cooldown upon projectile launch, therefore missing the attack wastes the soul and cooldown. cannot be

point. the damage is entirely based on the number of souls gathered with necromastery. the damaging lines have the following mechanics: the area of every single damaging line is shaped like a cone. the distance between the damaging lines is always even. one line is always released towards the east and the others adapt accordingly. creates a line on every 32.7 th/25.7 th/21.2 th/18 th ( 14.4 th) with the maximum number of souls on each level of necromastery. the damaging lines travel at a speed of 700, taking 1.43 seconds to reach the max distance. with the travel distance and end width, the damaging lines can hit units up to 1350 range away. each damaging line cannot hit the same unit more than once per cast upon expanding and returning respectively. fears and reduces the movement speed of all enemy units hit by the damaging lines of requiem of souls. the duration increases by 0.7 ( 0.95) per each line hit, but is capped at 2.15 ( 3.35) seconds. each line, including the returning lines, starts a new fear instance at the time of impact. requiem of souls' fear makes affected enemies run away from the caster, rather than make them run toward their team's fountain. affected creeps do not move. the expanding lines can deal up to 1600/2400/3200 damage to a single unit (before reductions), if all lines hit. each line first removes the movement and magic resistance reducing debuff, then applies the damage, then the fear debuff, and then re-apply the removed debuff. this means the lines' damage does not benefit from the magic resistance reduction at all. stacks multiplicatively

increases the total magic resistance by 1.05%/1.1%/1.15%. [?] upon death, requiem of souls is passively and instantly cast, regardless of mana and cooldown. if the caster does not have requiem of souls, it will not be passively cast. shadow fiend first loses 30% of his necromastery souls before this happens, so this passive cast can only have a maximum of 7/9/11/14 ( 17) lines. requiem of souls cast passively is not upgraded by aghanim's scepter, does not apply fear, but does apply the movement speed slow. the passive cast does not trigger with reincarnation. cosmetic has a cast backswing of 1.2 with the demon eater equipped. scepter after the lines expand to their maximum distance, they return back to shadow fiend. despite the visual effects, the lines do not ""respawn"" around shadow fiend. they start returning back exactly where they stopped. the lines return at the same speed to shadow fiend's current location, not to the location requiem of souls was originally cast from. the lines do not follow if shadow fiend moves. once the lines start returning, their path cannot be further altered. the maximum travel distance also applies to the lines also upon returning, meaning they travel a total distance of 2000, taking 2.86 seconds. the width of the lines is reversed upon returning starting with the maximum width and getting thinner towards the end. the returning lines deal 60% damage. they hit all units regularly like the expanding lines and also apply the movement speed slow and fear debuff. scepter the returning lines can deal up to 1200/1800/2400 damage to a single unit, if all lines hit. together with the expanding lines, it can deal up to 3200/4800/6400 damage to a single unit (before reductions). the heal is based on per hero hit by the returning lines, not by the initial expanding lines, and it is applied as soon as the lines stop moving. always heals for 48/72/96 health per hero hit, regardless of how much damage the lines actually dealt. only heals from damage dealt to heroes, including illusions. spell steal this ability's cast point is not modified when acquired. the lines created are based on shadow fiend's current necromastery stacks when acquired.","tango,healing salve,slippers of agility,clarity,regular stick,bottle,infused raindrops,magic wand,power treads,shadow blade,dragon lance,black king bar,hurricane pike,dragon lance,butterfly,blink dagger,arcane blink,blink dagger,eul's scepter of divinity,blink dagger,eye of skadi,assault cuirass,daedalus,satanic,desolator,silver edge,shadow blade,diffusal blade,monkey king bar,boots of travel,aghanim's scepter,manta style,scythe of vyse,ethereal blade"

pounce first applies the leash debuff, then apply 0/1/2/3 essence shift stacks based on its current level. essence shift notes fully apply. if it is not learned, no stacks are applied. stops the enemy by slowing their movement speed. the slow gets exponentially stronger towards the edges of the 120 leash radius. this effectively causes the target to come to a halt if the leash is stretched too much. the slow is only present when facing away from the center. the target is not slowed when facing toward the center. since the slow is fluctuating a lot, it is not displayed in the hud. the leashed enemy hero is prevented from casting certain mobility abilities. if cast before getting leashed, the following abilities are not able to break the leash: skewer, leap, pounce, tree dance, primal spring, toggle movement, and an enemy-targeted hurricane pike. every other position changing effect, can break the leash when stretching it beyond the maximum radius. force staff, hurricane pike, force boots, and psychic headband do not dispel the pounce debuff on the target, regardless of the maximum radius. when the leash expires while a position-changing effect (e.g. knockback) is ongoing, it instantly cancels the position-changing effect. this goes for the following abilities: flamebreak, primal roar, power cogs, hookshot, vacuum, gust, boulder smash, rolling boulder, geomagnetic grip, deafening blast, tether, blinding light, adaptive strike (strength), blast off!, charge of darkness, greater bash, timber chain, walrus punch!, force staff and hurricane pike. destroys trees within 100 radius around slark upon landing. pounce cannot be cast during pounce. during the leap, pounce is on a non-refreshable cooldown which is bound to the leap buff. deals 0

notes: desolate must be drafted as well for it to get applied. mercurial's dagger eclipses the physical plane in shadow, a state in which mortals cower, but spectres thrive. the spectral dagger travels at a speed of 800. treat clones, illusions and the spirit bear as heroes, other creep-heroes as creeps. when unit-targeted, the spectral dagger homes in on the target unit until it reaches it. only heroes can be unit-targeted. targeting other units other than heroes causes the spectral dagger to be ground-targeted. when ground-targeted, the spectral dagger travels 1800 range in a straight line and does not home in on any target. spectral dagger damages every enemy unit that comes within 125 range of the travelling dagger and applies movement speed slow with the path modifier. the dagger also applies one instance of desolate based on its current level if the target is a lone target within 400 radius. only units damaged by spectral dagger are considered valid targets for this desolate application. desolate notes fully apply. if it is not learned, or if the caster does not have desolate, no bonus damage is applied. spectral dagger first deals its damage, applies desolate, then applies the spectral dagger debuff. applies the dagger path creator debuff on hit enemy heroes, making them trail a shadow path like the spectral dagger. this debuff also grants shared vision over the enemy heroes, revealing their silhouette when they become invisible. grants spectre the following bonuses while on the shadow path: movement speed bonus from the path modifier, and its buff lingers for 4 seconds after leaving the path. successive movement speed buff refreshes its duration from the same source. an enemy spectral dagger does not apply the movement speed slow on spectre when she has the buff modifier. although the path modifier is applied on illusions, it does not increase their movement speed. unobstructed movement from a hidden buff, and its buff lingers for 1 second after leaving the path. the hidden buff is not applied to spectre's illusions. the shadow path's segments last 12 seconds from the moment they were created, not as the ability was cast. the shadow path grants 200 radius flying vision around itself. both the path modifier on spectre and on enemies while being on the path is dispellable. however, as long as spectre stays on the path, it is immediately reapplied to her again. for enemies, the movement speed slow debuff is not reapplied immediately but is applied again if they leave the path and enter it again. dispelling the path creating debuff on enemy heroes stops them from creating or extending the path, but does not remove already created paths. the number of debuff reapplication attempts is affected by the following conditions: when spectre, the primary target and the secondary target are in a straight line, the debuff will be reapplied 11 and 10 times on the secondary target with a 24-bound radius and an 8-bound radius respectively. the debuff will reapplied 8 times, when the secondary target touches, but does not intersect with the spectral dagger path. spectral dagger of different sources are independent of

that it fully works with spell damage amplification and spell lifesteal. works against any enemy unit, except for wards and buildings. desolate completely ignores nearby wards, buildings, ally couriers, invulnerable and hidden units. this means that desolate still deals its damage when the target only has any of the above as allies nearby. only checks for allies of the target, meaning nearby neutral creeps do not prevent it from dealing damage to units of the enemy team, and vice versa. dispersion ei abilitypassive ( no target) affectsself / enemies damagesource type(no-reflection)

enemies. this effectively reflects overkill damage dealt to spectre. if a damage source exceeded spectre's current health and killed her, the damage reflected will be the same damage value. if both spectre and an enemy would die to the damage simultaneously, the enemy is always killed first. applies generic incoming damage reduction on spectre. stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation. neither reduces nor reflects damage flagged as hp removal. effectively increases spectre's survivability against all damage types by 9%/14%/19%/25% ( 15%/20%/27%/33%). affects and reflects all damage types spectre receives, the reflected damage is returned as the same damage type as it was received. damage reflected is flagged as hp removal, it does not trigger any on-damage effects. reflected damage is not shared between enemies within the radius, all of them take the full amount of damage based on their distance with spectre. reflects the full 8%/12%/16%/20% ( 13%/17%/21%/25%) within a 300 radius from spectre. then the reflected damage decreases linearly up to a 800 radius from spectre. this is how much damage dispersion reflects back to enemies at certain

vision while traveling forwards, and while latched onto their targets. they are attached type units, and have the highest priority for auto-attack behaviors, together with phantoms. with the maximum travel distance, spawn radius, and latch radius, the beetles can latch on units 3400 range away. the beetle latches 64 range in front of any enemy unit that comes within 100 radius, unless another beetle has already latched onto it. this means that multiple casts do not affect the same unit more than once, and its duration cannot be refreshed. can latch on invulnerable units, but not invisible or hidden units. does not latch on enemy couriers. the beetle and its latched target have the following interactions: when the latched target turns invisible, while not under true sight, the beetle dies instantly. when the latched target is hidden, the beetle is still latched onto the target and not removed. when the latched target is affected by the following abilities, the beetle disappears: infest, dismember, gobble up and voodoo switcheroo. when the latched target is now untargetable, the beetle applies its first damage instance and the armor reduction debuff then dies after 0.13

enemy has no true sight on weaver. shukuchi can only damage the same unit once per cast. leveling up the ability while fully invisible does not update the current shukuchi damage instance. during the

first time, it has autocast on by default. despite being an active ability, geminate attack can trigger while silenced, if set to autocast. geminate attack's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range as the caster. however, it is not affected by cast range bonuses. both autocast and manually casting it use weaver's current attack range. causes weaver to

weaver first attacks, triggers both the geminate attack buff and attack damage bonus buff, then releases the extra attack. weaver has to be alive for these extra attacks to happen. there is no range limit for these extra attacks, they launch regardless of how far away the target is currently at. even if the initial attack damage kills the target before geminate attack triggers, the extra attacks are still released, hitting the dead target. for melee units, if the enemy target is farther than 350 range more than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss. works against enemy buildings, couriers and wards. neither work against allies nor observer and sentry wards. shard breaking the shukuchi invisibility in any way now procs geminate attack 0.2 seconds after on every enemy affected

commands are not canceled. scepter therefore, the cast backswing is only used when cast on allies. time lapse disjoints projectiles and applies a strong dispel upon cast. only affects weaver's position (or coordinates), health, mana, and status debuffs. buffs are not removed. sets weaver's or the target ally's health and mana back to what it was 5 seconds ago. time lapse neither deals damage nor heals. therefore, it does not interact with any on-damage effects. when cast right after respawning, the caster's health, mana, and position are set to what they were before death. this means that it does not kill the caster when cast immediately after respawning. scepter time lapse now turns into a unit-targeted ability, applying all the effects on the target. double-tapping automatically targets self. cannot be cast on allies who have disabled help from weaver. treats clones and illusions as heroes, and creep-heroes as creeps. scepter unit-targeting does not order the ally target to stop. therefore, channeling abilities are not canceled. when cast on allies right after respawning, their health, mana, and position are not set back to what they were before the death. this means allies cannot be sent back to their death location after respawning, unlike how weaver can when self-casting.","tango,healing salve,clarity,slippers of agility,circlet,wraith band,regular

much further, the spirits cannot damage units which are 1200 range away from death prophet. after each attack, the spirits need to return to death prophet before being able to attack again. the spirits deal damage on every attackable enemy unit upon reaching them, including buildings, wards, and units inside the fog of war. does not affect the following units: invisible units. ward-type units that require a fixed amount of attacks to destroy. undying zombies. invulnerable or ethereal units, but will continue to deal damage to the target if it turns invulnerable or ethereal after being acquired as a target. the damage is applied as spell damage in a separate damage instance, it is affected by spell damage amplification and works with spell lifesteal. it does not trigger any on-attack effects, ignoring evasion and damage block. outposts are considered valid targets despite not being attackable. couriers have the lowest target priority, they are only damaged if there are no other valid targets within range. when a spirit gets 2000 range away from death prophet, it disappears and then respawns from death prophet. reappearing spirits are still bound to the spawn interval, so when multiple spirits disappear, they do not reappear simultaneously on death prophet. the spirits heal death prophet upon returning once exorcism's duration is up. they do not heal her upon returning after each attack. always heals for the full amount based on their damage value, regardless of how much damage the target actually takes. this means upon having fully returned, a spirit heals death prophet by 15.5 16.75 ( 7.75 8.375) health per attack. grants a total of 1204%/1608%/32% movement speed bonus while active. successive casts cause the previous cast to end prematurely, making the spirits start returning to death prophet and heal her. scepter the passive spirits spawn only work with death prophet's abilities. it does not react to items cast or other abilities. a spirit also spawns on every successful attack or instant attack on a target, including buildings. does not spawn spirits when attacking wards and ally units. these passive spirits behave like the spirits from a regular cast, meaning they still use the max distances and have the same movement behaviors. they can chase their targets for up to 20 seconds before giving up and returning to death prophet. scepter the passive spirits deal 93 101 ( 47 50) damage, and therefore also heal for 23 25 health upon returning. the aghanim's scepter upgrade does not increase the spirit's damage of an active cast.","clarity,tango,healing salve,iron branch,magic stick,boots of speed,magic wand,iron branches,magic stick,null talisman,phase boots,eul's scepter of divinity,force staff,force

soon as it is spawned, so it can be killed before it reaches its target. phantoms are attached-type units, and have the highest priority for auto-attack behaviors. heroes and creeps deal 50/50/33.33/33.33 ( 33.33/33.33/25/25) and 16.67/16.67/11.11/11.11 ( 11.11/11.11/8.33/8.33) damage respectively to the phantom. treats attacks from clones and illusions as heroes, and attacks from creep-heroes as creeps. towers ignore the phantom. the phantom latches onto the target when it comes within 130 range of it. once latched, it always stays 130 range in front of the target. the phantom is instantly killed in the following conditions: when its target dies while traveling. when its target turns invisible, including while the phantom is still traveling towards it. when its target turns invulnerable or hidden, but not while traveling. if the phantom is in traveling, it will be killed when arriving at the invulnerable or hidden unit. the phantom returns to grimstroke at a speed of 1150 upon expiring, when its target dies, or after 10 damage instances. does not return when it is killed or instantly killed in the aforementioned conditions. chronosphere instantly causes already latched phantoms to return to their caster, and freezes traveling phantoms. while attached, the phantom silences its target and deals damage to it. the damage per second and rend damage component on the affected target is sourced to grimstroke, not the phantom. therefore, the damage is affected by outgoing damage manipulation and spell lifesteal. deals 5/10/15/20 ( 37.5/42.5/47.5/52.5) damage in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately upon reaching the target, resulting in 10 instances. can deal up to 170/300/430/560 ( 495/625/755/885) damage to each latched enemy, including the final rend damage (before reductions). successive casts on the target fully stack and share one debuff. the damage per second is increased for each stack. all phantom instances on the same target share the same damage interval and are summed up into one instance per interval. the phantom resets the cooldown of the phantom's embrace upon having fully returned to grimstroke. with multiple phantoms, each fully returned phantom resets the cooldown of the ability independently. the ability itself provides no vision, but the phantom provides 200 shared vision and ground vision over the target while flying towards it, and while latched. the granted vision instantly stops once the phantom unlatches itself from the target and while traveling back to the caster. the phantom is untargetable and uncontrollable while it returns to the caster. soulbind only the phantom returned from the primary target refreshes the ability's cooldown. ink swell link link link ew abilitytarget unit affectsallies

162.5/260/357.5/455) damage to a single unit (before reductions). shard ink swell also heals the affected ally based on the same damage intervals. the ability values are based on the number of damage instances the tendrils applied per enemy hero within the radius upon losing the buff or when the ink explosion sub-ability is used, regardless of how much damage the target(s) actually receive. this means to reach the max power, at least one enemy hero must be damaged throughout the whole duration of ink swell. treats clones as heroes, illusions and creep-heroes as creep. the ability values reaches max power after 13 instances. each damage instance increases the max power as follows: increases the stun duration by 0.1/0.14/0.18/0.22 seconds per damage instance applied. increases the expire damage by 7.2/14.4/21.6/28.8 ( 9.36/18.72/28.08/37.44) per instance applied. dispelling the debuff prematurely or casting the ink explosion sub-ability still applies the expire damage and stun within 375 ( 525) radius, centered on the affected unit, based on the damage instances applied up to that point. however, if the affected unit dies, ink swell does not apply the expire damage and stun within the radius. the expire damage and stun only apply when there is at least one enemy hero within 375 ( 525) radius. shard ink swell now heals the affected ally based on the tendril instances per enemy hero hit, and also when the buff expires following the ability notes above. both components always heal for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much damage the enemy target(s) actually takes. can heal up to 48.75/78/107.25/136.5 of the affected ally's health per damaged enemy over its full duration. the tendrils' healing value on the affected ally can still be subjected to heal manipulation. however, the heal per enemy at the end of the stun accumulation time utilizes spell lifesteal. stacks additively with other sources of spell lifesteal on the affected ally, and can still be subjected to spell lifesteal manipulation sourced to grimstroke. shard ink swell first applies the tendrils heal instance per enemy hero hit, the spell lifesteal as expire max heal, then the

those they were charged with protecting. in the years that followed the ruination of his kin, grimstroke discovered much more sinister applications for the binding rituals a list of unique interactions with soulbind can be found here. the targeting reticule must be centered over an enemy unit. only binds the primary target to heroes, clones and creep-heroes, excluding illusions. however, the primary target can be an illusion or the spirit bear. does not bind to nearby invisible or invulnerable heroes. leashes the target and the ally it is bound to, preventing them from casting certain mobility abilities. does not leash the target if it is not bound to an ally. exposes and provides shared vision and true sight over both targets. the more the chain gets stretched, the slower the affected heroes can walk away from each other, eventually coming to a full stop. it directly affects their movement speed. the chain is considered fully stretched at 600 range, but can be stretched up to 700 range before it breaks. in order to stretch it further than 600, forced movement sources or abilities with teleporting effects must be used. this means most forced movement sources can break the leash, except for the following abilities: skewer, leap, pounce, tree dance, primal spring, toggle movement, force staff and hurricane pike. however, force and hurricane thrust (ally) can break the chain if the target hasn't moved after being bound. if either enemy manages to break the binding link, the debuff stays active on the primary target and immediately leashes the next valid enemy target within the latch radius to them. the ability animations are based on and are affected by status resistance. this affects the following things on both the primary and the secondary target: expr statusresistance1 > statusresistance2 the chain disappears, and the primary target is no longer affected by soulbind. however, the secondary target is still fully affected by soulbind's effects. expr statusresistance2 > statusresistance1 the chain disappears, and the secondary target is no longer affected by soulbind. the primary target will still be fully affected by soulbind, and leashes the next valid enemy target following the ability notes above. a valid unit may only be affected by one soulbind at a time. successive casts on the same primary target, or on the secondary target refreshes the duration on both targets. successive casts on a third target within the range of the already linked two do not link the third valid target to any other two until the previous soulbind expires. the following conditions do not duplicate the unit-targeted ability onto the secondary target: abilities and item casts by creeps, including neutral creeps and dominated units, and creep-heroes. abilities that cannot be reflected by spell reflection. when an illusion is the primary target. when the primary target is affected by any other spell reflection sources. soulbind has the lowest priority in the group of spell refection sources. the duplicated ability cast also ignores all sources of spell reflection on the secondary target, this means the duplicated cast cannot be reflected again. most ability effects are first applied to the secondary target, then the primary target. charge-based abilities only consume a single charge when the ability is also cast on the secondary target. the duplicated ability interacts with spell immunity as follows: abilities that pierce debuff immunity when reflected are duplicated on the secondary target, which is stated in the ability's notes respectively. certain abilities that do not pierce debuff immunity will still be cast on the bound debuff immune target, applying other of its ability effects, despite not affecting them. talent the spell damage amplification talent applies generic incoming damage amplification on affected bound units. stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation.

more than 60 times. can bounce on the same unit multiple times, but only when another target was hit between the bounces. can bounce on invulnerable units only when the projectile is currently airborne. for undying zombies and couriers, chain frost can be cast on them, but not bounce on them. does not bounce on hidden and invisible units, and already invulnerable units. however, it can bounce on untargetable units from shadows and shadow realm. chain frost fully affects roshan only when the first instance is cast on him. otherwise, the projectile can bounce on, but neither damages nor applies its debuff. chain frost first applies the debuff, then the damage. leveling up the ability immediately updates all currently active chain frost projectiles. for how much damage (before

speed slow is provided by an aura, and its debuff lingers for 0.5 seconds. the damage and silence are independent of the aura. the revenants are always placed in the same formation, moving 0.2 seconds

increasing talent, 6 revenants are placed 60 symmetrically apart each other, the first revenant starting from the north, within the same range from the center of the target area, forming a hexagon

[?] 0.75 seconds after, they accelerate gradually up to a speed 57.3 per second for its remaining duration. therefore, in the first second, the revenants move a total of 22.92 of a rotation. therefore, this results in each revenant making 1.5 revolutions over the whole duration. since the revenants are placed on the edge of the effect radius, units at 60 range of the aura may only be damaged and silenced, but not slowed. only dying enemy heroes affected by the slow debuff within 120 radius refreshes the current aura duration and adds 1 additional revenant to the rotation, regardless how the kill was made. this includes the following: the enemy hero being denied or denying oneself. reincarnation sources. being killed by neutral creeps. however, forced kill sources neither refresh the aura duration nor increase the number of revenants within the aura radius. treat clones and the spirit bear as heroes, illusions and other creep-heroes as creeps. when the aura duration is refreshed, the additional revenant is always placed in the north, while other revenants move their position to keep all revenants symmetrically apart of each other, following the same ability notes as above. with the cast range, effect radius, and the revenant search radius, the calling can hit units up to 1040 range away. upon impact, the revenants first apply the debuff, then the

vision, and interact with other abilities the same way. sprout trees have a different model and are smaller than other trees on the map and they do not have a dying animation. destroying one tree is enough to allow units to walk in and out of the ring of trees. non-player-controlled units (i.e. lane creeps) do not try to path around the sprout trees, but simply walk against them as if they are not there. this effectively causes them to get stuck, until they change directions (e.g. when being aggro'd), or until the trees expire. sprout grants 250 range flying vision around the targeted point for its duration. the vision granted is not provided by the trees and remains even after all sprouted trees are destroyed. all other ability effects are applied by different auras centered around the sprouted trees, and are not bound to the sprouted trees respectively. the auras always last the full duration and lingers for 3/4/5/6 seconds, even if all trees are destroyed. despite the damage per

while active, false promise registers every damage instance (after reductions) the target would receive and keeps them in order. all healing instance received is summed up and doubled (before other amplifications and reductions). for false promise, only healing sources and health regeneration values are considered as on-heal effects. at the end of the duration, false promise checks to see if the sum of damage received is greater than the sum of healing received. then, the heal sum gets subtracted from each individual damage instance in order. this is repeated until either all damage instances are negated by the heal, or until the summed heal value depletes. if the heal sum depletes, then the remaining damage instances get applied in order. if the target dies, the kill is credited to whoever's instance that dealt the killing blow. in case the damage is from an ally, then the target is denied. if all damage instances are negated, the remaining heal value is applied as a single heal to the target. for a more detailed example explaining these interactions, please refer to the example below. while active, the following abilities grants the following amount of healing received: each

end of the duration. certain damage negation sources (e.g. gravekeeper's cloak or mischief) may reduce or avoid the damage applied at the end of the duration. if the target is invulnerable as false promise expires, the effects are applied as soon as the target is vulnerable. successive casts on the same target do not stack but refresh the duration. both the damage and heal value counters are not reset. scepter false promise also grants the target invisibility buff with a 0.15-second fade delay. as long as the buff is present, the target will keep turning invisible. during the fade delay, the

resistance sources. if a leashed enemy moves 600 range away from the coil, the leash snaps, stunning and damaging the enemy. it does not matter how far or how fast the enemy moves away, the stun and

from clones as heroes, and attacks from creep-heroes and illusions as creeps. the aura only affects enemy heroes, including illusions, clones, and creep-heroes. the damage is independent of the aura, so even though the debuff lingers, nether ward cannot damage units beyond 1400 radius. unlike the aura, the damage affects every enemy unit and not just heroes. the damage triggers on every instance of mana usage from abilities. if an ability costs no mana to use, it does not trigger it. this means if an ability uses mana over time (e.g. chakram), the flare triggers on every single instance of mana they use. the damage does not trigger on mana loss caused by abilities that removes mana offensively (e.g. mana burn or mana break). fully ignores abilities that do not trigger on-cast effects (i.e. active attack modifiers and toggle-abilities). the damage is dealt before the actual ability is cast, so if the target dies to nether ward's damage, the ability stays unused. this means that damage-negating effects with mana cost (e.g. refraction) or abilities granting spell immunity with mana cost (e.g. rage), do not save the caster if the damage is lethal. dying with reincarnation ready triggers the damage, but it does not prevent reincarnation from going off. the damage source is the ward itself, meaning certain on-damage effects (e.g. damage return) react on the nether ward rather than on pugna. fully affects invulnerable and invisible units and units in the fog of war. this includes neutral creeps despite not having the debuff on them. however, it does not deal damage to invulnerable units. shard life drain can now be cast on the nether ward, and causes it to refract and be cast on all enemy heroes within radius of the ward. life drain refracted this way treats illusions and creep-heroes as heroes. the range uses life drain's current cast range and is affected by cast range bonuses. this only happens once upon cast; enemies entering the refract radius after cast are not affected. life drain can be cast on any nether wards, regardless of factions. multiple life drains from different sources can be cast on the same nether ward as well, creating independent life drain refractions. although nether ward is refracting life drain, the damage is sourced to its caster, and not to the nether ward. therefore, the damage is affected by outgoing damage manipulation and spell lifesteal. shard life drain cast this way drains 120/180/240 health per second per affected target. can drain up to 1200/1800/2400 health per affected target (before reductions)

modifier_pugna_life_drain_spell_ampdeathpugna has truly become more powerful than even the grandmaster of oblivion. the links break when the targets turn invulnerable or hidden, exceed the break distance, or run out of health. when pugna turns invisible or is in the fog of war, life drain's particle effects continue to draw toward his last known location for the enemies. exposes the affected targets, and provides true sight over it. also provides a 10-second 200 radius ground vision centered on the affected target upon cast. this vision does not follow the affected target and its duration is independent of the channeling time. casting life drain on ally targets works akin of the ally casting life drain on pugna. the self-damage when targeting allies is also lethal, so it can be used to deny oneself. if pugna's or the ally hero's health is full and one of the damaged unit is a hero, it restores their mana instead. this means it also restores mana on allied creeps when they are at full health since pugna (i.e. a hero) is damaged. therefore, with spell lifesteal sources on pugna, he can restore the ally's health and restore his mana at the same time. the mana restored is neither affected by incoming nor outgoing mana restore manipulation. only restores mana to ally heroes. treats damaged strong illusions and creep-heroes as creeps. can be cast only on ally couriers. drains 40/60/80 health in 0.25-second intervals, starting 0.25 seconds after cast, resulting in up to 40 instances. can drain up to 1600/2400/3200 health (before reductions) when fully channeled. always heals for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much damage the target actually takes. can heal up to 1200/2100/3000 ( 1440/2520/3600) health when fully channeled. can restore up to 60/105/150 ( 72/126/180) mana per second when the affected ally hero is at full health. other heal amplification sources (e.g. decrepify and the heal increasing talent) further amplifies the mana restore values on full health. the color of life drain's link changes depending on the situation: when draining life from an enemy, the link is red green (pink blue if pugna is at full health). when draining life into an ally, the link is green green (blue green if the ally is at full health). instantly destroys targeted enemy illusions on the first instance. allied illusions are not destroyed. life drain first deals damage, applies the heal, then applies its spell damage amplification change on each interval. scepter life drain now applies generic outgoing spell damage reduction on the affected enemy target while applying the same generic outgoing spell damage amplification on pugna. stacks additively with other sources of generic outgoing damage manipulation. treats clones as heroes, illusions, and creep-heroes as creeps. the reduction affects only spell damage enemies deal that is not flagged as hp removal. grants a stack of 2% spell damage amplification in 0.25-second intervals, starting 0.25 seconds after cast, resulting in the same amount of instances as its damage instances. vice versa, the affected target loses the same amount of spell damage amplification per interval. can grant up to 78% spell damage amplification bonus when fully channeled. life drain can only grant up to 100% spell damage amplification bonus to pugna, while the affected target can only lose up to a flat 75%. with the spell damage amplification bonus, it can drain up to 2224/3336/4448 health (before reductions) when fully channeled. scepter each stack places a new buff/debuff on both pugna and the affected target and refreshes the buff/debuff duration. the counter modifiers on both pugna and his targets show how much spell damage amplification they gained or lost. upon death, the dying hero's outgoing spell damage values restore back to their normal values, while pugna keeps the spell damage amplification values for the remaining duration. shard multiple life drain sources can be cast on any nether wards or the same nether ward, regardless of factions. soulbind life drain on the primary target ends prematurely when the secondary target is no longer affected by it. however, prematurely ending the channeling on the primary target does not affect the channeling on the other target, even with soulbind's leash debuff expired.","iron branch,clarity,tango,healing

outgoing damage manipulation sourced to shadow demon. since it can be affected by incoming damage manipulation sources of the affected target, disseminate shares the overkill damage value, if the

on whether either ability is applied as a buff or debuff. this affects the following things: if both abilities are applied as a buff (or debuff) on the affected target, the reapplied duration will result as a buff (or debuff respectively), regardless of the remaining disseminate duration. if the abilities are applied as a buff and the other as a debuff on the affected target, the buff type of

silenced, the debuff duration is suspended and the damage and slow values are multiplied by 1.5 until the silence expires. the cooldown in the ability description refers to the debuff countdown instead of the ability's cooldown. suspends the duration by increasing the debuff's duration by 1 second on each interval. slows movement speed by 15%/22.5%/30%/37.5% for silenced units. deals an

drias gives him uncanny wisdom, which he applies to physical combat. glaives of wisdom's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. it is not affected by cast range bonuses. both autocast and manually casting it uses silencer's current attack range. the bonus damage is dealt in a separate damage instance, and counts as spell damage. this means it is not affected or considered by anything that works with attack damage. this also means that it fully works with spell damage amplification and spell lifesteal. glaives of wisdom neither work against nor bounce to allies, couriers, buildings or wards. checks silencer's intelligence upon projectile hit, so changes in his intelligence while the projectile flies affect its damage. glaives of wisdom first steal intelligence, and applies its spell damage, then the attack damage. therefore, the stolen intelligence affects the glaives' damage right away but still depends on the attack hitting the target. the temporary intelligence steal cannot reduce enemy intelligence below 0, but silencer always gains the full amount of intelligence, no matter how much the target has left. treat clones as heroes, and illusions as creeps. reduces the target's current mana by 12/12/24/36 ( 36/36/48/60), instead of keeping the current mana percentage. this lost mana is returned upon the debuff expiring. the target also effectively loses 0.05/0.05/0.1/0.15 ( 0.15/0.15/0.2/0.25) mana regeneration, and 1/1/2/3 ( 3/3/4/5) main attack damage if it is an intelligence hero. vice versa, it temporarily increases silencer's mana, mana regeneration, and main attack damage by the same amount per cast. unlike the target, silencer keeps his current mana percentage upon gaining and losing the temporary intelligence. each attack places a new hidden modifier buff/debuff on both silencer and the target. this means their durations are independent from each other. the counter modifiers on both silencer and his targets show how much intelligence they gained or lost. upon death, the dying hero's intelligence restores back to its normal values, while silencer keeps the bonus intelligence values for the remaining duration. permanently stolen intelligence is removed from the enemy's base intelligence and added to silencer's base intelligence. a +2 ( +4) appears above silencer's head, indicating that he stole the enemy's intelligence. the number of stolen intelligence gained/lost can be seen on the status buff icon. does not permanently steal intelligence if the enemy hero has reincarnation, is an illusion, from the tempest double. grants a stack in the following conditions as long as silencer or the owner of the ability is alive: the enemy hero(es) dying within the 925 steal radius, including denied enemy heroes. to permanently steal intelligence outside the steal radius, silencer has to be credited for the kill. other player-controlled units do not count. when meepo or its meepo clones is instantly killed due to either the prime or any one of its clones dying, only the prime gets its intelligence stolen. the permanent intelligence steal cannot reduce enemy base intelligence below 1. silencer also does not gain intelligence from heroes that are at 1 intelligence. enemy heroes effectively lose 24 ( 48) mana, 0.1 ( 0.2) mana regeneration, and 2 ( 4) main attack damage if it is an intelligence hero. vice versa, it permanently increases silencer's mana, mana regeneration, and main attack damage by the same amount per stack. the permanent intelligence steal is not retroactive, it cannot gain charges from kills and deaths before glaives of wisdom is learned. shard each successful attack with glaives of wisdom adds 1 to the attack counting buff. glaives of wisdom gain 1 charge when the projectile impact the main attack target. it does not count any hit by the glaives bounces talent. the buff is always present, but it is hidden when at 0 charges. neither count attacks done against allies, wards or buildings, nor triggers on the attack applying the silence. once the counter reaches 3, silencer gains the attack buff. the buff causes the next glaives of wisdom attack to apply a 1.75-second silence onto the all affected targets. as silencer is a ranged attacker, this buff remain active until a glaives of wisdom projectile impacts and applies the silence. this means the attack buff can affect more than 1 glaives of wisdom attack. attacks with this buff reset the counter and do not increase it. neither the charges nor the attack buff has a duration and last indefinitely. for silencer to continuously silence his attack target, he must have 366 attack speed or have an attack time of 0.44s (before status resistance reductions). note that as silencer is a ranged attacker, there is variation in the attack projectiles spawning position around silencer. so these values are not absolute. the movement of the target/its relative distance to silencer also affect the impact timing of the projectile. talent glaives of wisdom now bounces towards the closest enemy unit within 500 range of the attack target. if the projectile is unable to impact the main attack target (due to evasion, attack immunity, invulnerability...), it also does not bounce. the bouncing glaives travel at the same speed as the leading attack projectile. the projectile speed can be further increased by other attack projectile speed bonuses. does not bounce back to the same unit if it already hit all other nearby units. cannot bounce on invisible enemies or enemies in the fog of war. talent like normal glaives of wisdom hits, the bouncing projectiles deal 2 damage instances: a physical instance and an intelligence-based magic damage instance. however, they are not instant attacks. the magic damage instance is functionally identical to a normal glaives of wisdom hit. the physical damage instance is a physical spell damage instance with following properties: do not trigger any attack modifier or on-hit effects, and ignore evasion. affected by damage block sources and bulwark, but not resonant pulse. has the following flags: no-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing their damage from utilizing spell lifesteal. no-spell-amplification flag, preventing their damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification. is equal to damage amount calculated for the leading attack, which is determined upon attack begin. this means it works with critical strike and quell, since these are included in the initial damage calculations. this also means that it does not matter how much damage the attack actually did to the target, since that part is being calculated on projectile hit. it also means that other conditional attack damage bonuses (i.e. javelin damage proc) are not included, since these happen later in the calculations as well. last word link et abilitytarget unit ( target area) affectsenemies damagephysical enchants a

modifier_silencer_last_word_disarmanynortrom ensures that spells uttered by his opponents will be their last. when the target casts an ability during the 4 seconds initial debuff duration, the target gets damaged, then silenced and muted, and then the cast ability takes effect. although the silence happens first, the ability's effects are already queued up, therefore the silence does not prevent the target from casting the ability. however death does stop the ability, meaning if the damage from last word is enough to kill the target, the cast ability does not go off. this means that damage negating sources (e.g. refraction) do not block last word's damage. talent last word mutes items only when the affected target is silenced. fully ignores abilities that do not trigger on-cast effects (e.g. active attack modifiers and toggle-abilities). triggers on channeling abilities, but waits for the channel to stop first. with phase shift and tricks of the trade, last word only applies its effects when the ability is canceled by the player prematurely. this means if the aforementioned abilities expire on their own, last word's damage and silence are not applied. solar guardian and dissimilate does not trigger any aspects of last word. when the initial debuff expires, it still damages and silences the target. last word first applies the debuff, then the damage. deals the base

abaddon, who releases it at will. the projectile travels at a speed of 1300. deals pure damage to self and magical damage to enemies. the self-inflicted damage is applied instantly upon cast and never lethal, so it cannot be used to deny oneself. deals 40/70/100/130 ( 56/86/116/146) damage (before amplifications) to self. always heals for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much damage abaddon actually takes. cannot target invulnerable, hidden or untargetable units. for the targeted ally, the projectile still heals upon hit before they turn invulnerable or hidden. however, if the projectile hits once the targeted unit turns untargetable, mist coil does not apply its ability effects to the targeted unit. does not affect couriers. shard mist coil now causes abaddon to perform an instant attack on enemy targets on projectile hit. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers (e.g. curse of avernus) and on-hit effects normally. they have true strike and completely ignore disarms. if the caster is a ranged hero, the instant attacks do not use attack projectiles and are instant, but still count as ranged attacks. cleave effects are based on the target's position, damaging a trapezoid area in the opposite direction where the projectile came from. mist coil first applies its own damage, then the instant attack. talent the heal and damage increasing talent immediately upgrades all of abaddon's currently flying mist coil projectiles. the area of effect talent adds a radius to this ability. the ability must be centered over a unit still. upon cast, abaddon sends mist coils based on its current level towards every ally and enemy within 400 radius, excluding himself. these behave just like a regular cast, and can be disjointed normally. mist coil

targets self. applies a universal damage barrier on the affected target that absorbs damage values of all damage types, causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity. stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources. universal damage barrier has the lowest priority in the group of damage barriers, its capacity is depleted last when combined with other damage-type barriers. however, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g. borrowed time or refraction), aphotic shield does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire. losing the aphotic shield buff always causes it to burst and deal area damage, no matter how the shield was lost. therefore, successive casts on the same unit do not stack but destroy the shield, dealing its area damage, and a new one is applied. if the damage absorbed equals the shield capacity, the shield will burst at the next damage instance. does not deal damage to invisible units or units in the fog of war. can deal damage to untargetable units from book of shadows and shadow realm. always deals the full

takes after all reductions. the damage counter does not react on damage flagged as hp removal. the counted damage is checked on each damage instance. this means only one mist coil may be released per damage instance, no matter the amount of damage taken. if the counted damage is higher than the 525 health trigger threshold, the threshold value gets subtracted from it, and a mist coil gets released. since the threshold value gets subtracted from the counted damage, excess damage of big damage instances is not lost, and directly counts towards the next possible trigger. this means a single 1575 damage instance (i.e. 3 times larger than the trigger threshold) triggers one mist coil, but the next two damage instances are guaranteed to trigger a mist coil each. scepter the damage

nightmare has the second highest priority in the group of base vision setting effects, lower than tree dance. since consume increases the base nighttime vision, therefore, it is reduced by nightmare. however, other vision bonus sources (e.g. shade sight) are applied after the vision reduction. the nightmared target wakes up in the following conditions: when a unit other than the nightmare caster starts attacking it, including from manually casting active attack modifiers. when affected by fiend's grip or with the nightmare end sub-ability. the target does not wake up when taking damage from certain sources and under a few rare circumstances: from the following instant attack sources: sleight of fist, side gunner and stifling dagger. any damage instance from the nightmare caster, including attack and spell damage, except fiend's grip. any damage from active attack modifiers, be it a debuff (e.g. burning spear), or direct damage (e.g. tidebringer). any damage flagged as hp removal. any self-damaging sources (e.g. rot). any damage from already launched ranged attacks if the projectiles hit after the invulnerability period. when waking up with an attack, the nightmare is transferred to the attacking unit at the start of an attack point, not when the attack hits. when nightmare is transferred by attack the nightmared unit or from spell reflection sources, its duration is refreshed, including the 1-second invulnerability. the nightmare duration transferred is based on the duration of the first affected target. therefore, status resistance sources on the first affected target affects the following transferred nightmare durations. nightmare cannot be transferred to spell immune units, or to wards and buildings. so their attacks only wake up nightmared units. sleeping units are never automatically attacked, regardless of auto-attack settings. this means that sleeping units are never attacked by lane creeps, neutral creeps, towers and fountains. they are

drain is sourced to the illusion, not to bane. the illusions have a maximum duration of seconds, hard-capping the maximum time they can spend channeling. since the illusions are actually casting fiend's grip as well, this upgrade does not work for heroes who do not have fiend's grip (e.g. spell reflection). the fiend's grip illusions neither have gold nor an experience bounty. spell steal can be cast on the fiend's grip illusion. spell steal goes into cooldown and consumes mana, but does not acquire abilities. soulbind prematurely ending the channeling only cancels fiend's grip on the

values of already summoned brewlings upon leveling up the ability. casting primal companion replaces all existing brewling from a previous cast, creating new ones based on the current level of primal split and resetting the cooldown of all brewlings' abilities. primal split also resets the cooldown of primal companion upon cast. despite the ability's tooltip, the brewlings' abilities do not have a

potent bond with nature, as it often occurs in the midst of a drunken stupor. primal split formation the brewlings always spawn in the same formation, forming a square formation that fits within a 100-radius circle. the brewlings face the same angle as brewmaster upon cast. earth and void are spawned 100 range north and south brewmaster's cast location respectively. fire and storm are spawned 100 range east and west of brewmaster's cast location respectively. brewmaster is invulnerable and hidden during the split time and duration. does not apply dispel upon cast. during primal split, brewmaster is periodically moved to earth's position. if earth dies, brewmaster is moved to storm's position; if both earth and storm die, he is moved to fire; if earth, storm, and fire all die, he is moved to void. in short, brewmaster is moved according to the following sequence unless he is dead: earth storm fire void earth. shard this affects brewmaster's re-appearing position when the primal split cancel sub-ability is used as well. this brewling priority and sequence affect the following things: earth is selected by default upon cast, and can tab through units in the aforementioned order. every aura brewmaster has (e.g. gem of true sight etc.) is bestowed around the current brewling he is moved to. ability effects that interact with heroes' presence (e.g. smoke of deceit, blur etc.) react on the current brewling he is moved to. during primal split, brewmaster dies when all brewlings are killed. the kill is credited to the hero who kills the last brewling. once the duration ends, brewmaster appears at the place of the current brewling he is moved to. teleporting abilities (i.e. relocate) cause the periodic moving of brewmaster to get canceled, so the notes above do not apply anymore. the brewlings are summoned ancient creep-heroes, making them interact differently with several abilities. the brewlings are unable to activate runes. casting primal split replaces all existing brewlings from a previous cast or from a primal companion cast, creating new ones based on the current level and resetting the cooldown of all brewlings' abilities. scepter also resets the cooldown of primal companion upon cast. spell steal grants drunken brawler upon acquiring this ability. primal split cancel rr abilityno target affectsself cancel the primal split cast animation: 0+0

invulnerable and spell immune units can trigger the snare but are not damaged. once triggered, the snare becomes visible to enemies and disappears after 3 seconds. this timer is independent of the

need to turn to cast abilities or items within its cast range, this is not limited to only clockwerk's abilities. clockwerk is not disabled while jetpack is active. for better readability, the turn rate during the flight is given as degrees per second, instead of radians per 0.033 seconds. 75 ( 150 ) per second equal a turn rate of 0.044 ( 0.087). clockwerk turns for a maximum of 1 second per issued move order. this means a single move order does not cause him to fly in a circle around the targeted point. clockwerk's final path and direction pre-move order depends on a vector from his position to the targeted point, which is always parallel with the path. casting hookshot dispels jetpack if it latches on a target and starts pulling. does not end it if it misses. the flight speed

clockwerk armor flying through the air. the hook travels at a speed of 4000/5000/6000, taking a maximum of 0.5 seconds to reach max length. the effective area for the hook travel distance is half of a sphere and not a flat circle. therefore, the hook may latch onto units on the z-axis as well. provides 125 radius ground vision while the hook is traveling, and 300 radius ground vision while the hook latches or reaches its maximum travel distance. both vision radius does not linger. as soon as the hook latches on a unit, clockwerk is pulled towards the unit at the same speed as the hook itself. clockwerk gets pulled towards the latched unit's current location, and not towards the original location where the hook latched on it. this means when the target moves or gets moved, clockwerk's trajectory adapts immediately. clockwerk is silenced and disarmed during the pull. however, item abilities can be used. the pulling lasts a maximum of 0.5 seconds, so if the target moves too far away, clockwerk may not fully reach it. the pull gets canceled when clockwerk gets affected by other forced movement sources. the area damage and stun around clockwerk always happens, regardless of whether

the brambles spawn in 0.075-second intervals, starting 0.3 seconds after cast, so it takes 0.825 seconds for all brambles to spawn. the inner circle spawns first, starting with the east bramble, going counter-clockwise. the outer circle starts with the northeast bramble. brambles have to go through a 0.1-second activation delay after spawning. a bramble roots the first enemy unit which comes within

shadow realm while she moves does not stop her from attacking immediately. casting abilities or items during shadow realm does not end it, only attacking does. the shadow realm buff is lost upon launching an attack. upon launch, dark willow gets the attack logic buff, which is responsible for the damage. this buff disappears upon hitting the target, or within 3 seconds, whichever is shorter. therefore, if the projectile flies for more than 3 seconds before reaching its target, the spell damage is not applied. the buff only works for the attack that created it. any other projectiles launched afterward do not apply the spell damage bonus. scepter attacking now no longer ends shadow realm, and each attack launched applies the shadow realm spell damage bonus based on its accumulated

health prevents the affected target's current from dropping below 1 while active. this means the target cannot die to any incoming damage instances, not even damage flagged as hp removal. however, it does not manipulate the value of the incoming damage instance and fully procs on-damage effects. shallow grave prevents the target from dying to the following sources: ice blast's kill threshold. false promise's delayed damage. instant kill sources applied to illusions. does not protect the targets against the following sources: culling blade's kill threshold. wraith delay expiring. forced kill sources applied to the target, while affected by shallow grave. shallow grave can be dispelled by the following sources, despite being dispellable only by death: supernova dismember treats clones, illusions and creep-heroes as heroes. the halo ability effect appears at 190/240/300/350 range above the affected target, indicating its remaining duration, and it hits the ground right when

health percentage is checked periodically and the effects are adapted instantly. talent the heal on shallow grave end talent heals the target for 200 health upon losing the buff in any way. therefore,

wave has the following priorities on allies and on enemies: hurt heroes hurt non-hero units (including illusions) heroes non-hero units. the lower the health of the unit, the higher their priority. this means the lowest health units get healed first. if multiple units meet the same criteria (e.g. when only full health non-hero units are within range), it chooses between them randomly. fully heal and consider invulnerable allies and ally couriers as valid targets. regardless of the target, dazzle is always healed without counting towards the number of bounces, effectively healing 4/5/6/7

scepter the heal and damage multiplier now applies whenever shadow wave hits an enemy unit. when shadow wave hits an enemy unit, it now applies the increased damage on affected enemies, the increased

landing, the meteor deals its main damage and places the burn debuff to units within its effect radius in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately upon landing. on each interval, the meteor first applies the damage, then the debuff. the main damage and burn debuff is applied separately, but they each can hit a unit up to 4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/ times. the following chaos meteor damage calculations are all before reductions: the main damage can deal up to 220/400/630/910/1240/1620/2050/2420 damage. the burn debuff deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after the debuff is placed, resulting in 3 instances for each debuff. the burn debuffs from each interval fully stack and do not refresh each other. one instance of the burn debuff can deal up to 30/45/60/75/90/105/120/135 damage. all possible instances of burn damage per unit together can deal up to 120/225/360/525/720/945/1200/1485 damage. therefore, the whole chaos meteor, main and burn damage, can deal up to

the centered meteor. this means when the targeted point is within 346 range of invoker, they land further ahead of the centered meteor to keep a minimum distance of 200. this means, unlike the

target dies, when affected by an allied dismember, or when using the break tether sub-ability. the movement speed bonus is first applied to the tethered ally, then it sets io's base movement speed equal to the target's current movement speed. if the target has its movement speed slowed, tether copies the target's movement speed as if they are not slowed. however, it does not copy the target's movement speed while io is hasted. percentage-based movement speed changes on io are now based on this set value during tether. fully overrides any flat movement speed sources on io. while tethered, io is prevented from and cannot bypass the maximum movement speed limit, even if the tethered ally does (e.g. thirst). the tethered unit benefits from overcharge, relocate, and from io regenerating or replenishing health and mana. io's health regeneration, healing, lifesteal and spell lifesteal are transferred to the ally as healing. io's mana regeneration and mana restore are transferred to the ally as mana restore. tethered units still benefit from the aforementioned effects even when turning invulnerable or hidden. the heal and mana restore transfer happens regardless of how much io actually healed or restored, and is applied after all restoration manipulation sources on io. io's health and mana regeneration values are checked and transferred to the target in 0.1-second intervals, while the heal and mana restore values are checked and transferred on each server tick. if io or the tethered unit is invisible, enemies can only see a fake link leading to the invisible unit's last known location. if the tethered unit is visible to the enemy, enemies can still see the unit is tethered. the movement speed slow gets applied to every enemy that comes within approximately 55 range of the tether link on each server tick. cannot be cast on couriers. shard tether now passively grants io spell lifesteal and the 10% spell lifesteal is also shared with the tethered target. other spell lifesteal sources on io are not shared. stacks additively with other sources of spell lifesteal. heals for 2% from creeps. treats creep-heroes as creeps and does not heal off of illusions. the shared spell lifesteal is still sourced to io, not to the tethered ally. talent most of tether's talents affects both the target and io. the attack damage bonus talent immediately updates the tether buff both on the target and io. grants regular flat bonus attack damage. the ally movement speed bonus increasing talent immediately updates the tether buff on the

instant attacks on every enemy the tethered ally attacks. these instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. they do not have true strike. the attacks are performed as soon as the ally launches their attack (including instant attacks from the ally). it does not matter whether the attack actually hits or not. for melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss. if io is stunned or disarmed, no instant attack is performed. does not perform attacks when the tethered target also has this talent (i.e. an illusion of io). spell steal immediately breaks upon losing ability. morph notes immediately breaks upon losing ability and while morphing back to original form. break tether qt abilityno target break

intervals, starting immediately upon cast, taking 5 seconds to summon all 5 spirits. the first spirit is always spawned to the north of io, with the next spirit spawning behind the previous spirit. the spirits expand automatically to its 650 maximum distance upon cast. the spirits always rotate clockwise and are centered around io's location, following it wherever it goes. moving the spirits in or out do not break their formation. they always rotate in a circle and keep an equal distance from each other. the spirits complete a revolution every 2.7 seconds regardless of distance from io. their angular velocity is constant, meaning their speed increases the further away they are from the caster. this means the first created spirit can rotate at most 7 times around io. when a creep, illusion, or a creep-hero comes within 150 radius of the spirits, it takes the collision damage. heroes and the spirit bear do not take this collision damage. fully ignores couriers. when a hero, or a creep-hero comes within 110 radius, the spirit explodes, dealing the explosion damage and slowing enemies within a 360 radius. the explosion damage and slow affect all enemies within the area, not only heroes. scepter the explosions first apply the damage, then the slow. spirits do not collide with or explode on invulnerable or hidden units. remaining spirits explode simultaneously at the end of the duration, dealing the explosion damage around them. successive casts instantly cause the current active spirits to explode as well. spirits provide 3-second 150 radius flying vision at the location where they collided with a hero. they do not provide vision when exploding caused by expiring or recasting. the spirits are invisible to the enemy if io is invisible. can deal up to 150/250/350/450 ( 425/525/625/725) damage to a single unit when all spirits explode on a target (before reductions). scepter adds a passive component to spirits, constantly and passively spawning spirits around io with the same intervals, with the active component and effects still present. now instantly cause the current active spirits to explode upon cast. the spirits in and spirits out sub-abilities become permanently available as well. the spirits' now has an infinite duration and they do not explode unless colliding with heroes. if the spirits did not collide with a hero for more than 6 seconds, the next explosion will deal twice the damage. this is because when the colliding spirit exploded, the newly spawned spirit now takes its place and collides with the enemy hero again. when acquiring aghanim's scepter while a cast is already active, the spirits from that cast disappear without exploding while creating new spirits. when losing aghanim's scepter, the spirits from it

affected target for the debuff duration. the target can still turn, attack, and cast abilities. when the cast range exceeds 200, the target will be teleported 200 distance next to the spirit bear, fetch applies the root debuff and the target is dragged. the spirit bear is silenced, disarmed and prevented from acting. it will either last seconds, or until the rope is broken, whichever is shorter. upon cast, the spirit bear is ordered to follow lone druid even after the ability ends. the spirit bear can use items while fetching a target. when the spirit bear is affected by other fear sources while active, it moves according to the fear direction. the spirit bear no longer follows lone druid if any actions or orders are used to interrupt dragging the affected target to lone druid while the ability is active. when lone druid is dead while the ability is active, the spirit bear no longer moves and has to be resummoned to move. drags the affected target 200 distance behind the spirit bear. the affected target is phased and can be dragged over impassable terrain. fetch overrides most position changing effects. therefore, fetch has a higher priority on most forced movement sources. the following conditions can interrupt fetch: when either spirit bear or target dies. when spirit bear teleports a distance greater than 425 range. when the target gets teleported (e.g. relocate) at any distance. when being affected by same priority abilities: flaming lasso, dismember. casting these abilities after fetch will replace fetch, and vice versa. when being affected by higher priority abilities: hitch a ride, pulverize, walrus kick and arena of blood. it also breaks if the targets get affected by will-o-wisp, jetpack, fear and hypnosis sources. deals 60 damage (before reductions) in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately upon cast, with a total of 5 intervals. fetch first applies the debuff, then the damage. cannot be cast on, but can drag invulnerable and hidden units. can be cast on roshan, but he is neither rooted, dragged, nor damaged. each fetch's instance and duration are independent of each other. therefore, it is possible to have multiple units grabbed at the same time (e.g. with refresher orb). universal unit abilityinnate affectsself the spirit bear is a universal creep-hero unit. the bear cannot gain experience, but its health and damage increase with lone druid's level by 90 and 5 respectively. health bonus per hero level: 90attack damage bonus per hero level: 5 notes the spirit bear has no base attributes and does not gain them when leveling up. every point of / / attribute on the spirit bear grants their usual bonuses and increases its main attack damage by 0.7. the spirit bear immediately gains a flat 90 health and and 5 base attack damage every time lone druid levels up. grants flat base attack damage. therefore, it is affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions. grants max health, while the current health remains the same flat amount. level 30 grants a total of 145 base attack damage and 2610 max health bonus. the spirit bear's current health value from max health increasing sources is based on the ratio of its current health and 1100/1400/1700/2000 ( 2100/2400/2700/3000). it does not keep the current health percentage when affected by max health sources. the max health granted from lone druid leveling up is considered as max health bonus, and it is not factored into the current health calculations. this can be defined as expr (bearbasemaxhp maxhealthsources) (bearcurrenthp / bearbasemaxhp) the health calculation affects the following things: the spirit bear now has 1000/4000 health, and lone druid just purchased a vitality booster for the spirit bear. with level 4 summon spirit bear, the spirit bear has a base max health of 2000. in this example, the ratio between the current health and base max health is 50%. therefore, the spirit bear will have 1125 health with the item equipped with the current health values. the spirit bear has an inventory and backpack. can use every item, except for placing observer and sentry wards. can activate any rune, except wisdom rune. despite the value shown in the hud, spell damage amplification bonuses fully work for the spirit bear. the hud will always show 0%. talent all spirit bear related talents immediately

damaging a trapezoid area the opposite direction where the attacks came from. despite the audio, the slashes do not hit ethereal units, so that attack modifiers may not proc. also applies an instant attack on each enemy pangolier directly dashes through. if the caster is a ranged hero, the instant attacks do not use attack projectiles and are instant, but still count as ranged attacks. sets

225 range forwards upon cast, 250 range upwards. while in the air, other units can pass below him. interrupts pangolier's channeling abilities upon cast. during the short jump, pangolier is fully disabled and prevented from acting. the actual length of the jump depends on the terrain, jumping onto a higher/lower ground affects the duration of the jump, without affecting the jump distance. the area damage hits all enemies within range, but the buff only counts hit heroes, clones and the spirit bear. treats illusions and other creep-heroes as creeps. grants pangolier a universal damage barrier per affected hero within the radius that absorbs damage values of all damage types, causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity. stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources. universal damage barrier has the lowest priority in the group of damage barriers, its capacity is depleted last when combined with other damage-type barriers. however, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g. refraction), shield crash does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire. the five circling shields' visual effect around pangolier has three different states, based on how many heroes were hit. with 1 or 2 enemies hit, the shields are small and have no extra effects. with 3 enemies hit, the shields are larger and gain a light yellow flame-like effect. with 4 or more enemies hit, the yellow flame gets much stronger. successive casts refresh the duration and update the damage barrier capacity per enemy hero affected. if pangolier is stunned mid-jump, he does not apply the damage or gain the universal damage barrier buff upon landing. during rolling thunder and roll up, shield crash behaves differently and moves pangolier only vertically, and not horizontally. pangolier is not disabled when jumping during those abilities. due to how vertical and horizontal movement stack with each other, it does not interfere with abilities that move pangolier on the x and y-axis. when cast during rolling thunder, he effectively jumps in an arc, with a max height of 350 and the velocity of rolling thunder. when cast during roll up, he effectively jumps at a height of 350. when rolling thunder or roll up expires during the jump of shield crash, their duration gets expanded based on the jump's duration, so that the velocity is kept until landing. however, when rolling thunder or roll up are ended manually during the jump, via their end roll up or stop rolling sub-abilities, the velocity is lost, so that pangolier falls straight down. has a cast backswing of 0.54 during rolling thunder and roll up. sets the cooldown to 9/6/3s depending on rolling thunder's level whenever roll up or rolling thunder is active. fully affects current cooldowns as well. scepter swashbuckle of the current level is applied instantly upon cast, not upon landing. the location of the effect is set upon cast as well and does not follow pangolier. the angle is based on pangolier's facing angle, with the other swashbuckles being 90 apart from each other. swashbuckle applied this way neither prevents pangolier from acting nor cancels rolling thunder. swashbuckle notes fully apply. if it is not leveled, it is not applied. all slashes together can deal up to 50/90/130/170 ( 80/120/160/200) damage per hit enemy (before reductions). spell steal the passive swashbuckle applied is based on pangolier's current ability level when

taunts, phoenix can neither change directions nor use toggle movement and stop sun ray. sun ray sets phoenix's movement speed to 0 (has priority over hastes) and disarms phoenix for its duration, so

wait, burrowing under the surface to ambush his adversaries. the spikes travel at a speed of 2000, reaching max range in 0.26/0.3/0.34/0.38. the spikes do not travel the full distance when targeting closer than the max range. sand king is teleported instantly towards the targeted point once the spikes reach it. does not disjoint projectiles upon cast or upon teleporting. the burrowing and reappearing takes 0.53 seconds from the moment the ability is cast, during which sand king is disabled and prevented from acting. when unit-targeted, sand king chases the target until it is within range and casts burrowstrike toward its direction. the spikes still do not home in on the target, and thus can be evaded. unit-targeting only determines the direction upon cast. these interactions mainly affect burrowstrike's spell reflection as follows when reflected: when reflected, if the cast range is less than the range between sand king and the target, the reflected burrowstrike will be cast on the spot where sand king originally casts the ability. when the distance between sand king and the target is equal or greater than the cast range, burrowstrike will be reflected toward sand king as a unit-targeted ability. whether sand king is hit by burrowstrike depends on the distance between the two, as well as the burrowstrike speed. hit units are knocked up 350 range for the initial 0.52 seconds of the stun. while in the air, other units may pass below hit airborne units. the damage is applied upon landing, not upon getting hit. with the max cast range and radius, it can hit units up to 675/750/825/900 range away. burrowstrike first applies the stun debuff, the caustic finale debuff based on its current level, then the damage on all hit heroes. treats clones as heroes, illusions and creep-heroes as creeps. caustic finale notes fully apply. the debuff is applied even if it is not leveled, but does nothing. spell steal / morph notes caustic finale applied is based on

can only be interrupted in the following conditions: when snapfire is affected by silence, cyclone, hex, sleep, taunt, or fear sources. when other orders, except for attack and movement orders, are given to snapfire. stun sources using the modifier_stunned reliably interrupt mortimer kisses. other disabling sources (e.g. forced movement from enemies) may interrupt mortimer kisses only if the disabling duration is greater than the intervals between two launched globs. therefore, neither teleport sources nor being affected by the following abilities cancel mortimer kisses. glimpse, return or nether swap. firesnap cookie does not cancel mortimer kisses if it was cast by an ally. the following effects are applied on snapfire while mortimer kisses are active: sets snapfire's movement speed to 0 (has priority over hastes) and disarms snapfire for its duration, so it cannot move or attack. attack orders behave like move orders during disarms, right click on an enemy sets a new location as well. reduces snapfire's turn rate to 0.15 while launching globs. the location for the globs can be changed with a move order ( right click or m). the destination for each glob is marked with a red circle indicator, which is visible to allies only. although the ability reduces snapfire's turn rate while active, the globs are launched where the order was targeted, they are not launched based on facing angle. each glob deals the impact damage and leaves a lava puddle behind. the puddles last 3 seconds. the puddles apply the debuff on enemies in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately as they are created, resulting in 7 instances. the debuff lasts 1 second, and deals 30/40/50 damage in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately upon being placed, resulting in 3

taking priority. a single glob can deal a total of 450/630/810 ( 510/690/870) damage, considering impact damage, and standing within the puddle for the full duration (before reductions). provides 275 radius flying vision at the current targeted location for the globs, lasting until mortimer stops launching projectiles. the projectiles provide a 500 radius flying vision as they travel. this vision lingers for 3.5 seconds at the impact area. leveling up mortimer kisses does not update the impact damage of already launched globs. however, the lava puddles are updated to apply the debuff with the current value. already placed debuffs are not updated to the current values.","tango,healing salve,enchanted mango,clarity,boots of speed,infused raindrops,headdress,arcane boots,mekansm,blink

types (after all reductions), causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity. stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources. universal damage barrier has the lowest priority in the group of damage barriers, its capacity is depleted last when combined with other damage-type barriers. however, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g. refraction), reactive armor does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire. the pure damage barrier has a 200 base capacity, and gradually increases up to 800 capacity based on the number of enemy heroes within 600 radius. the capacity increases and regenerate in 0.1-second intervals, up to

clones and creep-heroes as heroes, and illusions as creeps. scepter dispelling the reactive armor buff removes the damage barrier, causes it to burst and deal area damage prematurely. this includes timbersaw dying while the buff is active, it instantly blows up, damaging enemy units around timbersaw based on the current remaining capacity. the area damage (before reductions) can be defined as

so breaking it prevents windranger from going invisible again. windranger can pick up or drop items without breaking the invisibility. scepter also applies generic incoming damage reduction on windranger that only reduces physical attack damage for its duration. stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation. neither reduces nor reflects damage flagged as hp

upgrade:new ability grants the gale force ability. modifiers [?]modifier_windrunner_focusfiredeath lyralei's ability to bombard opponents with a flurry of arrows is unparalleled - even at the expense of accuracy. the cast range of focus fire is based on the attack range of the caster. it can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. however, it is not affected by cast range bonuses. however, this does not include the unlimited range while hurricane pike is active. upon cast, focus fire orders windranger to attack the target and allows her to move while attacking the target. windranger automatically attacks the focus fire target whenever she is in attack range unless she is given an order that is not a move or attack order. the automatic attacking can be paused by ordering her to stop (s) or hold position (h) once. when paused, she no longer attacks the target while moving. to resume the automatic attacking, a new attack order ( right click) on target or (a) must be given to her. reduces the windranger's main and bonus attack damage when attacking the affected target. this can be defined as: expr (mainatk + bonusatk) 0.70 ( 0.82) does not reduce conditional attack damage bonuses (e.g. pierce or shadow walk). stacks additively with other total attack damage reduction sources. windranger can switch attack targets without losing the buff against the focus fire target. when switching attack targets, the attack speed and damage adapt as soon as the attack begins. casting focus fire on multiple targets only grants the attack speed and damage reduction against the most recent target. focus fire ends prematurely when windranger dies but persists through the target's death. can be cast on any enemy unit, including buildings and couriers, excluding wards, invulnerable or hidden units. talent the focus fire cooldown advance talent cause focus fire to skip 18 seconds of its current cooldown if the targeted enemy hero dies. treats clones as heroes, illusions and creep-heroes as creeps. the cooldown skip always triggers and it does not matter how the enemy target dies or to whom the death is credited. this effect can be triggered multiple times per cast, with reincarnation sources, buyback, or against a resummoned tempest double. soulbind does not affect the secondary target at all.","tango,healing salve,clarity,iron

modifier_winter_wyvern_winters_curse_auraundispellable modifier_winter_wyvern_winters_cursedeaththe oldest of the bookwurm's spells, this curse lends truth to the old saw: sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my enemy still. winter's curse first applies a basic dispel on the affected target, then the stun. stuns and provides true sight over the target, while the affected target's allies within the radius are taunted, forcing them to attack the primary target. enemies that enter the radius after cast are also taunted for its remaining duration. if no valid enemies are within 525 radius for a total of 2.5 seconds, the debuff gets removed. neither affects nor checks for spell immune, invulnerable, or hidden enemies, wards or buildings within the radius. only affects units allied to the target. this means when cast on an enemy, neutral creeps are not taunted, and vice versa. despite not getting taunted when targeting an enemy, neutral creeps still prevent the curse debuff from being removed prematurely. cannot be cast on couriers. the taunt is based on an aura, with an infinite linger duration. the debuff gets cleared when the debuff on the primary target expires, or when the target dies. has the same taunt priority with berserker's call, little friends and life break, but lower than duel. this means the taunt sticks on the affected units, and getting moved outside the radius does not free the unit from the taunt. this also means the taunt lingers even if the debuff is removed on the primary target due to no enemies within the area. the taunt area is centered on the primary target and follows them when they are affected by other forced movement sources. applies the following incoming damage manipulation on affected enemy targets within the radius. stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation. 100% damage reduction against the following sources: all physical attack damage and spell damage sources. magical attack damage sources (e.g. pierce). does not reduce pure attack damage sources. 30% damage amplification against the following sources: all magical spell damage sourced from winter wyvern (e.g. arctic burn, splinter blast), from item abilities, from her player-controlled units. this is not limited to only winter wyvern's basic abilities. pure attack damage sources (e.g. death ward's attacks against the primary target). does not amplify magical attack damage sources. since other generic incoming damage amplification sources (e.g. flesh golem) stack additively with winter's curse, it can be used to counter the effect, causing the affected units to receive damage. however, it does not reduce the damage flagged as hp removal. winter's curse has a lower priority than reaper's scythe, but higher than little friends, in the group of kill credit manipulation effects. all damage dealt to the affected target, including from allies, during the taunt duration is sourced to winter's curse, and credited to winter wyvern. even when the taunt duration expires, the kill is also credited to winter wyvern if the allied projectile kills the affected target. when combined with other kill credit manipulation effects (e.g. reaper's scythe), reaper's scythe takes priority instead. however, the following conditions do not credit winter wyvern with the kill credit: when the affected target is brought into supernova during the taunt duration. forced kill sources applied to the affected target during the taunt duration. when the affected target dies from ice blast's max health percentage kill threshold. when the affected target enters wraith delay. does not disable any abilities. however, most passive abilities do not affect allied units. when the primary target dies, the taunt effect ends immediately.","tango,clarity,iron branch,magic wand,mekansm,magic stick,boots of speed,wind lace,urn of shadows,bracer,magic wand,holy locket,arcane boots,holy locket,glimmer cape,spirit

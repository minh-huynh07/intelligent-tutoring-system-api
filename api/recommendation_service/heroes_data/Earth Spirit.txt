boulder smash has different targeting rules based on whether earth spirit wants to smash a distant remnant, a nearby remnants or units. has the following stone priorities within range: an enchanted remnant stone remnant the closest unit. cast range bonuses affect the search range of nearby units or remnants to be smashed, as well as the cast range for smashing distant units or remnants. when there are no valid targets near earth spirit or at the targeted point, the ability is not cast. smashing a distant remnant: to do this, the ground must be targeted. there must be a stone remnant within 180 radius around the targeted point. if a remnant is found, he walks towards the point until the remnant is within 180 range. any remnant he meets on the way is ignored. only the closest remnant to the targeted point is smashed. upon reaching the remnant, he smashes it toward the direction he approached it from. smashing a nearby remnant: to do this, the ground must be targeted. there must not be a stone remnant within 180 radius around the targeted point. there must be a stone remnant within 180 radius around earth spirit. boulder smash has a default cast range of 2000. this range allows him to aim the stone remnant precisely. when targeting beyond 2000 range, he walks up until the point is within range. if there is a remnant nearby, he smashes it. smashing a distant unit: to do this, the unit must be directly targeted. there must not be a stone remnant within 180 range of earth spirit. he walks up until the target is within 150 range and smashes it towards the direction he approached the target from. cannot be cast on allies who have disabled help from earth spirit. smashing a nearby unit: to do this, the ground must be targeted. there must not be a stone remnant between earth spirit and the targeted point. there must be a unit within 180 radius around earth spirit. boulder smash has a default cast range of 2000. this allows him to aim the unit to the targeted point precisely. when targeting units beyond 2000 range, he walks up until the point is within range. if there is a unit nearby, he smashes it toward the direction of the targeted point. cannot be cast on allies who have disabled help from earth spirit. boulder smash first applies the damage, then the knockback debuff. smashed remnants first apply the damage, then the slow debuff. the movement speed slow is applied to all enemy units within the radius of a smashed remnant. a smashed unit is neither slowed nor applies slow on other units. damage is applied to all enemy units within the radius of a smashed stone remnant or smashed unit. the smashed enemy is damaged instantly upon cast. smashed allies are not damaged. can deal up to 168/252/336/420 ( 308/392/476/560) damage (before

cannot be cast on ancient creeps. can move units and stone remnants over impassable terrain. destroys trees within 100 radius of which the targeted units or stone remnant collide during the knockback.

the stun duration also gets increased to 0.6/1/1.4/1.8 ( 1.1/1.5/1.9/2.3). only the first remnant will be used and destroyed when rolling over multiple remnants along its path. for stone-enchanted

earth spirit rolls while still being rooted and disarmed. grants invulnerability while rolling. other abilities and items can be used normally while rolling, except for rolling boulder, which cannot

while rolling. rolling boulder is canceled when earth spirit is affected by the following disables during the effect delay: stun, cyclone, hex and sleep sources. hidden sources, including enchant remnant. fear and hypnotize sources. fully-disabling forced movement sources (e.g. vacuum). when affected by taunt sources, earth spirit starts attacking the taunting unit once the rolling stops. the

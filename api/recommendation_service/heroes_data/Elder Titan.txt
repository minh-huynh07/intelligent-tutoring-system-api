preventing them from acting, until woken up. if a unit is hit by both damage components of the stomp, it takes 140/200/260/320 ( 290/350/410/470) damage (before reductions). echo stomp first applies the physical damage, the debuff, then the physical damage. when the astral spirit is summoned, it performs the stomp perfectly synchronized with elder titan. the sleep is applied around elder titan and the spirit. if the radii overlap, the duration does not stack up. if the spirit is not summoned, or astral spirit is not learned, both physical and physical damage are centered by default around elder titan. the astral spirit has echo stomp as well, with a different icon. ordering the spirit to cast it forces elder titan to simultaneously cast his part. when being cast on the spirit while elder titan is disabled, it goes on cooldown for the spirit and does nothing. however, elder titan can still use it afterward and the spirit still mimics, despite its own being on cooldown. when elder titan casts echo stomp while the astral spirit is disabled, it still casts its part. echo stomp cannot be canceled by ordering the spirit to stop. during the echo stomp animation, the spirit cannot act. astral spirit's echo stomp does not have a cast point and it is not affected by cooldown reduction sources on elder titan. affected units cannot be woken up for the initial 0.2 seconds of the sleep. after the initial part, units wake up only after cumulatively taking 55/120/185/250 ( 505/570/635/700) damage. the counter starts counting damage (after all reductions) during the initial stun part. this means if the unit took enough damage during the 0.2-second duration, it may instantly wake up on the next damage instance afterward. the wake-up damage threshold does not count astral spirit's damage but does count earth splitter's. sleeping units are never automatically attacked, regardless of auto attack settings. they are never attacked by lane creeps, neutral creeps, towers and fountains. players can still force an attack order on the target ( right click or a). shard upon acquiring the ability upgrade, it has alt-cast disabled by default. when the channeling succeeds with alt-cast activated, elder titan is teleported to the astral spirit's current location. this causes the astral spirit to instantly re-unite with elder titan, they do not swap locations. does not

technique, the magic missile is shendel's primary tool for vengeance. the projectile travels at a speed of 1350. magic missile first applies the debuff, then the damage. shard the projectile now bounces on another unit at the same speed, prioritizing heroes, within a 487.5 ( 581.25) radius. the bounce distance can be further increased by other cast range increasing sources. the total bounce radius can be defined as expr currentcastrange 0.75. shard magic missile can bounce to invisible, untargetable, and units in the fog of war. can never hit the same unit twice per cast. if the current target turns invulnerable or hidden, it does not bounce upon reaching them. all bounces together can deal up to 180/360/540/720 ( 580/760/940/1120) damage (before reductions). wave of terror link we

4-second 350 radius flying vision as it travels. this vision starts 100 range away from vengeful spirit. with the travel distance and vision radius, the vision reaches up to 1850 range away. reduces the target's main and bonus attack damage. does not reduce conditional attack damage bonuses (e.g. pierce or shadow walk). stacks additively with other total attack damage reduction sources. successive debuffs do not stack, but update its ability values and refresh its duration. the wave first applies the debuff, then the damage. talent the stolen damage and armor is 20% of the target's total damage and armor, not 20% of the reduced the reduced values. stolen damage is added as main attack damage. buff will be added even if the target has debuff immunity, and is unaffected by the

although they may not share her undying passion for revenge, allies do draw on her fanaticism in combat. the aura's buff lingers for 0.5 seconds. grants flat bonus attack damage based on the affected unit's main attack damage. does not further increase bonus attack damage. the aura affects invulnerable, but not hidden allies. scepter vengeance aura now creates 1 strong illusion 108 range away either north, east, south or west at vengeful spirit's death location, including with reincarnation. it spawns with full mana, health, and all abilities off-cooldown, regardless of their cooldown status on vengeful spirit. the illusion is visually distinguishable from the real vengeful spirit for enemies. the vengeance illusion's duration is set equal to vengeful spirit's respawn time upon creation. the buyback next respawn time increase does not further increase the illusion's duration. the illusion disappears once vengeful spirit respawns, or when it reaches the normal death duration. the vengeance illusion has the following properties: it is visually distinguishable from the real vengeful spirit for enemies. uses the hero health bar instead of the regular unit health bar like other illusions. can cast abilities, but not item abilities. neither has gold nor experience bounty. enchant treats the vengeance illusion as heroes. scepter while dead, vengeful spirit is now periodically moved along with the vengeance illusion, allowing her to gain experience around the illusion following the same experience acquiring conditions. however, all of these ability upgrade effects require the illusion to be alive. if the vengeance illusion dies, she neither is moved along nor can gain experience. this also allows her to respawn at the illusion's location, instead of at the fountain. upon respawn, vengeful spirit's facing angle same as the last vengeance illusion's facing angle, and she is fully affected by the fountain invulnerability buff. spell steal can be cast on the vengeance illusion. spell steal goes into cooldown and consumes mana, but does not acquire abilities. nether swap link rw abilitytarget unit affectsheroes damagemagical instantaneously swaps

gains the buff, no matter if she targets an ally or an enemy. affects all damage types the affected ally units receive. does not reduce damage flagged as hp removal. soulbind swaps position with the secondary target upon casting on the primary target. vengeful spirit first swaps position with the primary target, then the primary target swaps with the secondary target, then the secondary target swaps with vengeful spirit.

lifestealer's abilities are hidden, while infest is replaced by the consume sub-ability. lifestealer is now invulnerable, hidden, spell immune, and is periodically moved to the host's current position. this affects the following things: upon infest ending in any way, lifestealer reappears at the host's current location. every aura lifestealer has (e.g. radiance) is bestowed around the host. ability effects that interact with heroes' presence (e.g. smoke of deceit, marksmanship) react on the host's presence. relocate forces lifestealer out of the infested unit, dealing its area

continues its attempt to move to the last known location of its set target. the affected unit also receives a hidden modifier, which creates the visual effect above it, visible to allies only. infest also has the following cast restrictions on units: level 1+ can be cast on, but cannot control ally heroes and ally creep-heroes. level 2+ can be cast on and control ancient creeps. cannot be cast on roshan, couriers, undying zombies, wards, buildings, enemy heroes and enemy creep-heroes. reinforced units receive 10% less damage (before reductions) from the infested creep. the ability's cooldown

when autocast.manually casting it uses the cast range. harbinger's outworldly knowledge allows it to tap into the ebb and flow of all spiritual energy, infusing it into his being. arcane orb's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. it is not affected by cast range bonuses. both autocast and manually casting it uses outworld destroyer's current attack range. the bonus damage is applied as spell damage in a separate damage instance, it is affected by spell damage amplification and works with spell lifesteal. arcane orb first deals the spell damage, then the attack damage, but still depends on the attack hitting the target. checks outworld destroyer's current mana upon projectile hit, so increasing or decreasing the mana pool while the projectile flies does affect its damage. astral imprisonment link wt abilitytarget unit affectsenemies / allies damagemagical places a target unit into an astral prison. the hidden unit is invulnerable and disabled. when the astral prison implodes, it deals damage to the target and steals a percentage of their max mana. cast animation: 0.3+0.4cast range: 650 ( 750)damage:

infantile knowledge and mortality. astral imprisonment fully disables the target and turns it invulnerable and hidden for its duration. it also slows the affected target's movement speed by 30%. however, this has no effect since the target is fully disabled. cannot be cast on allies who have disabled help from outworld destroyer. double-tapping automatically targets self. targeted allies are imprisoned without any of the other effects being applied to them. shard astral imprisonment now neither disables the ally target nor hides their model. instead, it slows their movement speed by 30%, while turning them invulnerable, phased and untargetable, while sliencing, muting and disarming them for its duration. upon cast, astral imprisonment first steals the max mana of the affected enemy hero, then applies its damage at the end of the imprisonment duration. treats the spirit bear, clones and illusions as heroes, creep-heroes as creeps. reduces the target's max mana by 16%/18%/20%/22% ( 21%/23%/25%/27%), while keeping its current mana values. the same applies when the target(s) gain their mana back while outworld destroyer loses its mana upon the buff duration expiring. only their max mana value is increased, the current mana value stays unchanged. vice versa, it temporarily increases outworld destroyer's max mana by the same amount and keeps its current mana values per cast. each cast places a new hidden modifier buff/debuff on both outworld destroyer and the target. this means their durations are independent of each other. the counter modifier on both outworld destroyer and its targets shows how much max mana they gained or lost. upon death, the dying hero's max mana restores back to its normal values, while outworld destroyer keeps the max mana bonus values for the remaining duration. always steals for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much max mana the target actually loses. the red ring expanding at the center of the visual effects indicates a fixed 4-second duration. the red ring is visible to allies only. essence flux link ee abilitypassive affectsself passively grants you a chance to restore a percentage of your max mana each time you

harbinger's rifts. restores mana after other abilities are cast. can restore 7.5%/10.5%/13.5%/16.5% of outworld destroyer's max mana per ability cast on average. can restore mana from any active abilities, including toggleable abilities, sub abilities and ablities which can not trigger on-cast effect. does not proc on any item abilities. essence flux uses pseudo-random distribution. scepter essence flux first applies a strong dispel upon activation, then applies the buff. passively activates when a damage instance, including 0-damage instances, drops its health below 20%, or hits outworld destroyer while already below 20% health. essence flux trigger condition is shown below: when current health is more than 20%, if expr receiving damage (calculated before terminal damage block) > current health - 20% max health, essence flux will trigger. when current health is less than 20%, any damage instance (including 0 and negative) will trigger essence flux. essence flux can be activated by any damage, includeing damage flagged as hp removal. but health setting and instantly killing can not activate. when triggering moment, essence flux actually applies a 100% terminal damage block, it loacted after almost all damage manipulation, causing several on-damage effects to not trigger. the terminal damage block can affect any damage, including damage flagged as hp removal. but can not affect health setting and instantly killing. scepter after triggering, essence flux grants outworld destroyer a universal damage barrier, with a capacity based on 70% of outworld destroyer's max mana. fully absorbs damage values of all damage types, causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity. stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources. universal damage barrier has the lowest priority in the group of damage barriers, its capacity is depleted last when combined with other damage-type barriers. however, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g. refraction), essence flux does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire. scepter the upgraded passive component does not reapply again in the last 79 seconds. the stack limit duration has the following properties: the duration is set upon cast and is always 1 second less than the cooldown. cannot be reset by cooldown resetting sources. can be extended by time dilation. sanity's eclipse link rc abilitytarget area affectsenemy heroes / self damagemagical

factions, but not other invulnerable or hidden units. however, the mana allergy debuff is not applied on hidden units. the damage multiplier is based on the max mana of outworld destroyer and hit

sources (e.g. chakram), the heal triggers on every single instance of mana. heals for 0 hp when units affected cast abilities with 0-mana cost. the mana allergy heal does not trigger on the following sources: on mana loss caused by abilities that removes mana offensively (e.g. mana break). fully ignores abilities that do not trigger on-cast effects. therefore, it will not trigger any heal instance even if these abilities cost mana. mana allergy self-heals per enemy ability cast based on its original mana cost, regardless of distance. mana cost reduction sources do not affect the self-healing

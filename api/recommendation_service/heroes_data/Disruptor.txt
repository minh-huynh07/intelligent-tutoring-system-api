thunder strike link qc abilitytarget unit ( target area) affectsenemies damagephysical repeatedly strikes the targeted unit with lightning. each strike damages nearby enemy units in a small radius and slows enemy movement speed and attack speed by 100 for 6 seconds. provides vision of its target. cast animation: 0.05+0cast range: 800 ( 1600)radius: 240number of strikes: 4 ( 6)damage per strike:

125/130/135/140 aghanim's shard upgrade: increases the cast range and strike count of thunder strike. it can now also be ground targeted, where it will lie dormant for up to 7 seconds and attach to the first enemy that comes within the radius. debuff immunity notes:exposure pierces debuff immunity.modifiers [?]modifier_disruptor_thunder_strikeany modifier_disruptor_thunder_strike_speedany modifier_disruptor_thunderstrike_slowanydisruptor's charged coils occasionally overload, and a singed armor plate or tuft of fur is the enemy's result. turning invulnerable or hidden does not stop thunder strike from hitting other units within the radius. exposes the affected target, but does not provide true sight over it. thunder strike hits all enemies within the kinetic field if the affected target is within the kinetic field radius. the strikes first apply the slow debuff, then the damage. talent the movement speed slow increasing talent immediately updates the currently active instance. the debuff persists through death. if the target dies, thunder strike continues to apply damage at its death location. strikes the target in 2-second intervals, starting immediately as the debuff is placed, resulting in 4 strikes. can deal up to 100/220/340/460 ( 150/330/510/690) damage to a single unit (before reductions). provides a 3.34-second 450 radius flying vision at the target's last location when the debuff expires or when it is dispelled. successive casts on the same unit do not stack but refresh the duration. shard adds area-targeting functionality to thunder strike, it may be unit-targeted on an enemy or ground-targeted. when targeting an enemy, it follows the targeted enemy like how a regular cast does. when ground-targeted, thunder strike lies dormant for 7 seconds. if an enemy unit comes within range during its dormant duration, thunder strike attaches to it and strikes the target following its ability notes. if no enemy unit comes within range after the dormant duration, it strikes the ground. acquiring aghanim's shard does not update the current active instance. glimpse link wd abilitytarget unit affectsenemy heroes damageinstant kill / physical

projectile travels at a speed of 600, or reaches the mark in 1.8 seconds, whichever is faster. the projectile provides 400 radius flying vision while traveling, which lingers for 3.34 seconds at the marked location. if the target has been alive for less than 4 seconds, the target gets moved to the team's fountain instead. the location at which the target lands after glimpse is marked with a blue visual effect which is visible to everyone. does not move debuff immune or hidden units, but can move invulnerable units. does not kill strong illusions. following the general rule of position changing effects, it can cancel abilities like time walk or ball lightning. the target is silenced and is given a stop command as soon as it is moved back, effectively canceling channeling abilities. glimpse deals damage (before reductions) to the affected target upon arriving at the marked location. deals 25 damage per 280/200/155.56/127.27 ( 87.5/77.78/70/63.64) distance, based on the distance between the start and end point upon arrival, reaching max damage values at 1400 distance. does not disjoint projectiles for the target upon teleporting them. cannot be cast on creep-heroes. kinetic

is immune to the gale-force winds that will consume its adversaries. the actual kinetic field duration starts right after the 1-second effect delay. the visual and sound effects during the effect delay are visible and audible to everyone. provides a 5.5-second 350 radius ground vision at the center of the area upon cast. stops enemies by slowing them with a movement speed slow aura. the aura has a radius of 418 and is centered on the field. the slow gets exponentially stronger towards the visible barrier, which has a 350 radius. this effectively causes enemy units touching the barrier to come to a halt. the slow is only present when facing the barrier. units at the barrier facing away from it are not slowed. the aura's effect lingers for 0.5 seconds, resulting in an effective duration of 3.1/3.7/4.3/4.9 ( 5.1/5.7/6.3/6.9) seconds. since the slow is fluctuating a lot, it is not displayed in the hud. stops units with flying movement and units with unobstructed movement as well. besides preventing enemies from walking in or out of the area, the following movement abilities are unable to pass the barrier either: jetpack, starbreaker, skewer, rebound (initial dash), god's rebuke, leap, primal spring, tree dance, sun ray, onslaught, pounce, firesnap cookie, arctic burn, force staff and hurricane pike. the following units are not affected by abilities, however, they also cannot pass the barrier: phantom and healing ward. deals 0 damage to units affected by the slow modifier in 0.25-second intervals. fully procs on-damage effects (e.g. corrosive skin), except for abilities that have a minimum damage threshold (e.g. gravekeeper's cloak) and on certain exceptions (e.g. blink). despite dealing exactly 0 damage, it visually displays that it deals 1 damage in 0.25-second intervals. thunder strike hits all enemies within the radius, as long as the enemies are affected by a kinetic field debuff. this includes the outer edge kinetic field (i.e. the visible barrier with 350 radius), and other allied kinetic fields. static storm link rr abilitytarget area affectsenemies damagephysical creates a damaging static storm that also silences all enemy units in the area for the duration. the damage starts off weak, but increases in power over the duration. cast animation: 0.05+0cast range: 800storm radius: 550 ( 750)number of pulses: 20 ( 26)max damage per

an oglodi can survive. both the silence and mute are provided by an aura, its effects do not linger. static storm applies all effects to invulnerable units, but not hidden units. scepter does not update the current instance if the affected target is within the effect radius while acquiring the item. since the ability upgrade is determined if disruptor has aghanim's scepter equipped when the affected target(s) are within the effect radius, therefore, the effect radius applies the mute upon enemies re-entering. deals a total of 20 ( 26) damage instances over 6 ( 7.5) seconds, resulting in 0.3-second (or 0.288-second) intervals. the damage on each instance is determined by the given max damage per second, divided by the max instance, then multiplied by the current instance count. can deal up to 630/866.25/1102.5 ( 810/1113.75/1417.5) damage to a single unit (before reductions). provides a 6 ( 7.5)-second 550 ( 750) radius flying vision at the center of the radius upon cast. for how much damage static storm deals in each interval on each level, with the duration increasing talent, please refer to the chart below.

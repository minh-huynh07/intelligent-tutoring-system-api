Aghanim's Shard Upgrade:

Lowers Cooldown. Echo Stomp may be placed on autocast to allow Elder Titan to take the place of the Astral Spirit as it completes its stomp.

modifier_elder_titan_echo_stompStrongThe force of creation still echoes in the stomp of the Titan.

Alt-Cast IconAstral Spirit's icon.
If the channeling is interrupted, the ability does nothing, and goes into cooldown while consuming mana.
Applies sleep on affected units, preventing them from acting, until woken up.
If a unit is hit by both damage components of the stomp, it takes 140/200/260/320 ( 290/350/410/470) damage (before reductions).
Echo Stomp first applies the physical damage, the debuff, then the Physical damage.
When the  Astral Spirit is summoned, it performs the stomp perfectly synchronized with Elder Titan.
The sleep is applied around Elder Titan and the spirit. If the radii overlap, the duration does not stack up.
If the spirit is not summoned, or  Astral Spirit is not learned, both Physical and physical damage are centered by default around Elder Titan.
The  Astral Spirit has  Echo Stomp as well, with a different icon. Ordering the spirit to cast it forces Elder Titan to simultaneously cast his part.
When being cast on the spirit while Elder Titan is disabled, it goes on cooldown for the spirit and does nothing.
However, Elder Titan can still use it afterward and the spirit still mimics, despite its own being on cooldown.
When Elder Titan casts Echo Stomp while the Astral Spirit is disabled, it still casts its part.
Echo Stomp cannot be canceled by ordering the spirit to stop. During the Echo Stomp animation, the spirit cannot act.
Astral Spirit's Echo Stomp does not have a cast point and it is not affected by cooldown reduction sources on Elder Titan.
Affected units cannot be woken up for the initial 0.2 seconds of the sleep.
After the initial part, units wake up only after cumulatively taking 55/120/185/250 ( 505/570/635/700) damage.
The counter starts counting damage (after all reductions) during the initial stun part.
This means if the unit took enough damage during the 0.2-second duration, it may instantly wake up on the next damage instance afterward.
The wake-up damage threshold does not count  Astral Spirit's damage but does count  Earth Splitter's.
Sleeping units are never automatically attacked, regardless of auto attack settings. They are never attacked by lane creeps, neutral creeps, towers and fountains.
Players can still force an attack order on the target ( Right Click or A).
SHARD Upon acquiring the  Ability Upgrade, it has Alt-cast disabled by default.
When the channeling succeeds with Alt-Cast activated, Elder Titan is teleported to the  Astral Spirit's current location.
This causes the Astral Spirit to instantly re-unite with Elder Titan, they do not swap locations.
Does not disjoint projectiles upon teleport.
Does not cause Elder Titan to mimic the spirit's facing angle.
If the spirit is not summoned, nothing happens.
TALENT The wake damage threshold increasing  talent does not update the current instance on already sleeping units. However, the wake damage threshold is instantly increased while channeling Echo Stomp. Astral Spirit Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️WC

Notes

InvulnerableUnobstructed PathingOnly selectable by caster.



 Astral Spirit is controllable by Elder Titan until the end of its duration.
Other players cannot select the spirit, so it cannot be used to prevent selecting other units behind it.
The Astral Spirit spawns facing Elder Titan in a straight line.
The Astral Spirit neither interacts nor intercepts with any ability (e.g.  Hookshot).
Does not block neutral creep camps.
Upon cast, the following effects are applied to the Astral Spirit:
Sets its  Echo Stomp cooldown equal to Elder Titan's  Echo Stomp current cooldown.
Sets its movement speed equal to Elder Titan's movement speed and does not adapt to it afterward.
The spirit has a min and max movement speed of 315 ‒ 550 respectively. The max movement speed cap is not removed even if the caster unlocks the maximum movement speed.
If  Natural Order is learned, the aura's debuff is always applied before the Astral Spirit's damage, effectively increasing it.
The Astral Spirit unites with Elder Titan when it comes within 100 range of him, walking through it also returns it.
When Elder Titan dies, the Astral Spirit disappears as well.
Casting  Echo Stomp while the spirit returns forces the spirit to stop and simultaneously cast his part. It continues returning once the cast finishes.
Upon having returned, Elder Titan receives the astral titan buff, which grants regular flat bonus attack damage, movement speed and bonus armor per hit enemies.
Treats clones as heroes, and creep-heroes as creeps.
Buff from successive casts refreshes the duration, and updates the ability values based on its current level and amount of enemies hit.
If no enemies were hit, neither the buff is placed nor refreshes the existing buff.
Does not count the following units:
Illusions and  Couriers.
Invulnerable and hidden units.
For how much bonus Astral Spirit grants after hitting a certain amount of heroes, please refer to the chart below.
Leveling up the ability immediately updates the current active instance.
TALENT Both the movement speed increasing and attack damage bonus increasing  talent immediately update the current active instance as well.
SCEPTER On top of that, the returned spirit now applies a basic dispel on Elder Titan, then grants 2 seconds debuff immunity per hit heroes following the same ability notes.
The buff grants Elder Titan a flat  magic resistance bonus for its duration, and stacks multiplicatively with other magic resistance sources.
Increases Elder Titan's magic resistance to 62.5%.
With the magic resistance bonus from this source, every 10 points of  intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 0.5%. [?]
The debuff immunity buff duration from successive casts stack additively and extends by the same amount per hero hit, and can be defined as:
expr Remainder + HeroHit × 2
The ability upgrade is determined if Elder Titan has  Aghanim's Scepter equipped while Astral Spirit returns, and not upon cast.
SPELL STEAL The Astral Spirit summoned does not have  Echo Stomp unless it is acquired as well. The spirit disappears into the ground upon losing the ability, during which it neither damages nor grants any of its ability bonuses. Return Astral Spirit Link▶️Link▶️WC

modifier_elder_titan_natural_order_magic_resistanceUndispellableAbility Draft Notes:
 Astral Spirit must be drafted as well for the magic resistance reducing debuff to get applied.
As it was at the beginning, Elder Titan makes it so again.

Astral Spirit's icon.
The armor reduction is based on the affected units' main armor. Direct armor bonuses are ignored.
Adapts the armor reduction based on how the affected units' armor changes due to  agility loss or gain in 0.5-second intervals.
Magic resistance reduction is based on the affected units' base magic resistance. Magic resistance bonuses are ignored.
This means, with 25% base magic resistance, it reduces magic resistance by 10%/15%/20%/25%, down to 15%/10%/5%/0%.
The magic resistance portion of the aura is always centered on the  Astral Spirit, even if it is not summoned.
While not summoned, the spirit is hidden and periodically moved along with Elder Titan, so that effectively, it is centered around him.
 Astral Spirit does not need to be learned for the magic resistance portion to apply, the spirit is already created upon the initial spawning of the hero, even at ability level 0.
The aura's debuff lingers for 1 second.
However, if Astral Spirit gets cast, enemies around Elder Titan who are not within range of the spirit's aura immediately lose the magic resistance reducing debuff.
Neither affects invulnerable nor hidden units.
Does not affect ancient creeps. Move Astral Spirit DD

     Earth Splitter formation.  
Earth Splitter first deals 17%/21%/25% of the affected units' max health as Physical damage, then 17%/21%/25% as physical damage.
Leveling up the ability during its effect delay updates the movement speed slow, but not the damage value.
With the crack distance and crack radius, Earth Splitter can hit units up to 2415 range away.
Also affects units up to 315 range behind Elder Titan's cast position.
The crack extends at a speed of 882.94.
While the crack extends, vision fields get created in a line along with it.
The vision fields provide 500 radius flying vision and last for 4 seconds each.
The first vision field spawns 200 range in front of Elder Titan. The following ones spawn 200 range away from the previous vision fields.
The vision fields are spawned in 0.22-second intervals, starting 0.22 seconds after cast, spawning a total of 12 fields.
All vision fields together reach up to 2900 range away with their vision.
Earth Splitter first applies the debuff, then the damage.
Affected units are instantly pulled towards the crack once it implodes.
Forces a stop command onto the targets upon pulling, so that its current move, attack, and ability cast orders and channeling abilities get canceled.
Does not affect ancient creeps.

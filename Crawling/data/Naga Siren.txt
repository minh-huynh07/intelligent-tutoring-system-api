Slithice, while being strong in her own right, is notoriously hard to track down.

     The illusions' formations.  
Applies a basic dispel on Naga Siren and disjoints projectiles upon cast.
Naga Siren is invulnerable, hidden and spell immune during the 0.5-second split time.
After the 0.5-second split time, Naga Siren reappears with her illusions.
The reappear locations are based on Naga Siren's position upon cast, with one appearing at the cast location, and the others north, east, south, or west from that point.
This means when spawning 3 illusions, the formation is T-shaped and when spawning 4 illusions, it is shaped like a plus.
Though the formation is always the same, Naga Siren and her illusions take a random position in the formation and have all the same facing angle.
The illusions have a expr 2 × IllusionLVL bounty.
The distance in between each created illusion is 108-distance if the caster's collision size is 27, and 72-distance if its collision size is 18.
Orders the caster to stop after the split time, canceling all queued orders, and orders given during the split time.
Also stops all ongoing targeted orders of other units that have been issued before Mirror Image was cast.
Successive casts replace the illusions from the previous cast, no matter under whose control they are. Ensnare   Link▶️Link▶️WE

modifier_naga_siren_ensnareAnyAbility Draft Notes:
Toggling Autocast on swaps this ability out with  Reel In. Their cooldowns are separate.
The only way to escape the onslaught of a Slithereen is to never oppose one in the first place.


The net travels at a speed of 1500 ( 2400).
Roots the target, preventing it from moving and casting certain mobility abilities.
Provides True Sight over the target.
Can be cast on and fully affects any invulnerable unit, not just sleeping units.
Fully affects  Couriers.
All illusions owned by Naga Siren within 900 range of the target also cast a fake Ensnare.
They play the whole cast animation and release their fake nets at the same time the real net is released.
When illusions currently do not have any order and are standing still, they turn to face the target and cast the fake nets.
When illusions are moving or attacking, they continue to do so and do not turn to face the target. They still play the cast animation, overriding their move or attack animations.
When canceling the cast, the illusions still play the full cast animation, but do not release the fake nets.
The fake nets do not interact with anything and do not root.
SCEPTER Increases the default cast range to 800/840/880/920.
Stacks additively with other sources of percentage-based cast range manipulations, and is calculated after all flat cast range bonuses. Rip Tide   Link▶️Link▶️ED

modifier_naga_siren_rip_tideAnyA torrent from the Deep Ones crushes the defenses of the Siren's enemies.


Each successful attack performed by Naga Siren or her illusions applies the attack counter buff on Naga Siren.
If the buff is already present, its stack count gets increased instead.
Counts attacks against any enemy unit, except buildings.
The counter buff has no duration and lasts indefinitely.
When the counter reaches 6 ( 5), Rip Tide's effects are applied around all units under Naga Siren's control that have this ability, and the counter buff is removed.
Enemies may only be hit by one instance, even when within range of multiple Rip Tides. Neither the damage nor the debuff stack.
The damage source of all Rip Tides is the unit that performed the triggering attack, meaning on-damage effects react on the unit that triggered it (e.g.  Blade Mail).
Rip Tide first applies the armor reduction debuff, the Rip Tide damage, then the attack damage. Reel In Link▶️DL

Naga Siren is unable to level Song of the Siren up while this sub-ability is active.
Goes into a 1-second cooldown right after Song of the Siren is cast, this is to prevent accidental double-casts prematurely ending the ability.
When cast, affected units wake up after the aura's 0.4-second linger duration.

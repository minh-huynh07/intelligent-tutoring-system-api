Split Earth first applies the debuff, then the damage.
Destroys trees within the affected radius.
Split Earth has no visual or audio indicator during the effect delay.
SHARD Split Earth now applies its effect 4 times at the targeted point.
The first instance still happens 0.35 seconds after cast. The following instances happen 5.35/10.35/15.35 seconds after cast.
The visual effect during the delay between the extra instances is visible to everyone.
Each instance has the following radius:
LEVEL 1 150/195/240/285 ( 190/235/280/325)

Chronoptic energy bursts from one plane to the other, evaporating anything it touches.


Diabolic Edict's radius is centered on and follows Leshrac.
Randomly selects nearby valid units, including buildings, for each explosion. There are no priorities.
Fully affects invisible units and units in the Fog of War.
When no valid targets are nearby, the explosions randomly appear within a square with 500 side lengths. These random explosions deal no damage.
Creates explosions in 0.25 ( 0.15)-second intervals, starting immediately as the ability is cast, resulting in 40 ( 65) explosions.
Can deal up to 400/720/1040/1360 ( 650/1170/1690/2210) damage (before reductions) to a single target.
Successive casts of Diabolic Edict fully stack, with each cast creating its own independent instance.
When Leshrac dies, the explosions still occur at his death location. Lightning Storm  Link▶️EG

modifier_leshrac_lightning_storm_slowAnyThe Tormented Soul's mastery of the elements is evident in the massive storms that strike down armies before him.


The lightning hits the initial target after the 0.25-second effect delay and then jumps to other targets in 0.25-second intervals, so hitting all targets takes 1.25/1.75/2.25/2.75 seconds.
This means the initial lightning can be avoided by being invulnerable, hidden, or spell immune. However, this does not prevent it from jumping.
Lightning Storm does not jump on to invisible units, or units in the Fog of War.
The lightning storm buff is a hidden buff required for the lightning to jump. It cannot hit the same unit again per cast.
All jumps together can deal up to 450/980/1710/2640 damage (before reductions) per storm instance.
Successive cast of Lightning Storm fully stack, with each cast creating its own independent instance.
Lightning Storm first applies the damage, then the debuff. Nihilism Link▶️Link▶️DR

Requires drafting  Pulse Nova to be unlocked.



Requires  Aghanim's Scepter to be unlocked.
Interrupts Leshrac's channeling abilities upon cast.
Turns Leshrac and all enemies within the radius ethereal, disarming them, rendering them attack immune, and granting 100% physical damage resistance.
The ethereal effect on enemies is provided by an aura, its debuff lingers for 0.5 seconds.
The magic resistance reduction of multiple ethereal effects does not stack, the one with higher value takes priority.
Dispelling the buff on Leshrac ends the ability prematurely.
Stacks multiplicatively with other  magic resistance sources.
Reduces most heroes' magic resistance to 2.5%.
With the magic resistance reduction from this source, every 10 points of  intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 1.3%. [?]
Successive casts do not stack but refresh the duration. Pulse Nova  Link▶️Link▶️RV

Does not interrupt Leshrac's channeling abilities upon toggling On / Off.
If toggled On, Pulse Nova continues working even when silenced, disabled, or hidden.
When toggled Off, Pulse Nova goes on a fixed 1-second cooldown.
This cooldown can be reset with cooldown resetting abilities, but it is not affected by percentage-based cooldown reductions.
Drains 25/45/65 mana in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second upon activation.
However, Pulse Nova deals its damage immediately upon activation.
Fully affects invisible units and units in the Fog of War.
TALENT
Applies generic incoming damage reduction on Leshrac while active. Stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation.
Reduces all damage types Leshrac receives, except from damage flagged as HP removal (e.g.  Sunder).
The Pulse Nova Lightning Storm  talent passively triggers a single  Lightning Storm strike on a random unit within 700 radius, prioritizing heroes.
Treat illusions and clones as heroes, creep-heroes as creeps.
The auto Lightning Storm strike uses fixed replenish time and is not affected by any cooldown reduction sources.
Once a strike happens, the effect has to recharge for 2 seconds.
Does not strike invisible units or units hidden in the Fog of War.

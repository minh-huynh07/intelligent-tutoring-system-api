Aghanim's Shard Upgrade:

Reduces Fissure cooldown and allows Earthshaker to walk on it. When he casts any ability, an Aftershock is released along its path that stuns for a shortened duration.

modifier_earthshaker_fissure_stunStrongAbility Draft Notes:
 Aftershock must be drafted as well for it to get applied.
The Nishian totem splits the world to its core with tectonic force.

      
Fissure's effects are instantly applied within its whole area. There is no travel time.
The fissure is created using many segments lined up in front of Earthshaker. The amount of segments determines the total effective range of the Fissure.
The segments have a collision size of 24, and a distance of 8.25 between each other, with the first one being placed 8.25 range in front of Earthshaker.
This means the actual length of the Fissure can only be a factor of 56.25.
It is defined as expr(2 * 24 + 8.25) so that it never exceeds the listed values.
Therefore, Fissure consists of 28 ( 32) segments, resulting in an actual range of 1575 ( 1800).
Every unit, except wards and buildings, within that radius upon cast is pushed aside.
The stun and damage are applied in a circular shape around each segment. This means the total damage/stun radius consists of multiple overlapping circles, and not a smooth line.
A unit can only be hit by one instance per cast, even when within the damage/stun radius of multiple segments.
Can hit units up to 1800 ( 2025) range in front and 216.75 range behind Earthshaker.
Fissure first applies the debuff, then the damage.
Units with flying movement (e.g.  Arctic Burn) or unobstructed movement (e.g.  Spectral Dagger) are not blocked by Fissure.
They still are fully affected by it otherwise when hit. They are pushed aside, stunned and damaged.
Non-player-controlled units (i.e. lane creeps) do not try to path around the Fissure, but simply walk against it as if it is not there.
This effectively causes them to get stuck, until they change directions (e.g. when being aggro'd), or until the Fissure dissipates.
SHARD Each of the Fissure segments now provide a 150 radius aura affecting its caster only, with a 1-second linger duration.
The aura grants its caster phase and unobstructed movement, while also allowing the caster to path through Fissure.
The caster also may path through anything while standing on the Fissure and for a short time after leaving its area.
For Earthshaker, as long as he has the modifier active, he has phased movement and can path through all created Fissures, regardless of faction. This is innate to Earthshaker.
SHARD Fissure also applies  Aftershock, with a reduced stun duration of 0.5/0.55/0.6/0.65 seconds, based on its current level around each of its segments whenever it gets triggered.
A unit can only be hit by one instance of Aftershock per cast, even when within the damage and/or stun radius of multiple segments or multiple different Fissures. Enchant Totem Link▶️Link▶️WE

Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
Enchant Totem becomes a ground target ability, causing Earthshaker to jump in the air and land at the target spot, casting Enchant Totem there. Self-casting the ability will behave in the original form, without jumping. Grants Enchant Totem a cleaving attack.

Raigor's gorilla strength can destroy mountains.


Increases Earthshaker's attack range to 250 upon cast.
Grants attack range bonus based on the caster's attack range type.
Grants flat bonus attack damage based on the caster's main attack damage. Does not further increase bonus attack damage.
The Enchant Totem buff is only used up upon successfully hitting a target.
Missed attacks, destroying items or Runes does not dispel the buff.
Leveling up the ability or the attack damage bonus  talent does not instantly update the current active instance.
COSMETIC Has a cast backswing of 0.6 with  Planetfall equipped.
SCEPTER Enchant Totem turns into an area-targeted ability. It may only target the ground or self.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
The targeting reticule shows the radius of  Aftershock, even when it has not been learned yet.
When self-targeted, Enchant Totem behaves like the non-upgraded version, using 0.98-second cast animation and not leaping. Earthshaker is unable to self-target when he is invulnerable.
SCEPTER When ground-targeted, it has no cast point or cast backswing.
The leap duration is always 0.8 seconds, so the speed adapts based on the targeted distance. The leap height is always 950 range on the z-axis.
During the leap, Earthshaker is fully disabled and prevented from acting.
While in the air, other units may pass below Earthshaker.
The ability counts as cast as soon as the leap starts. However,  Aftershock and the totem buff are applied upon landing.
The leap can not be dispelled even when caster is dead. And  Aftershock will still trigger at the cast location.
Getting disabled during the leap does not prevent the Aftershock and the totem buff from being applied.
Getting hit by other sources of forced movement causes the leap's trajectory to change, but it is not interrupted. However, it causes the ability to not apply Aftershock or the totem buff upon landing.
The ability is fully and immediately canceled when being affected by upward movement, teleport, root, and leash sources.
The Enchant Totem buff grants the caster cleave for its duration if the caster's attack range type is  melee.
Cleave damage has the following properties:
It counts as spell damage. However, it has the following flags:
No-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing its damage from utilizing spell lifesteal.
No-spell-amplification flag, preventing its damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification.
Cleave damage is based on the attack damage value of the cleaving unit, and can be reduced by damage block.
The complete cleave area is shaped like an isocseles trapezoid in front of the attacking unit.
Multiple sources of cleave fully stack and work independently.
Does not cleave upon attacking wards, buildings or allied units.  Couriers, wards and buildings are unaffected by cleave.
Despite the visual effect, the cleave damage is applied instantly in the whole area. Aftershock  ET

Causes the earth to shake underfoot, adding additional damage and stuns to nearby enemy units when Earthshaker casts his abilities.

modifier_stunnedStrongThe earth trembles beneath the mighty footsteps of Raigor.


Does not trigger on active item abilities, on abilities with 0 cooldown, or on abilities that do not trigger on-cast effects.
Aftershock first applies the stun debuff, the spell damage, then the effects of the triggering ability.
The stun does not stack with the stun of  Fissure. It follows the regular rule of stuns — the longer stun overrides the shorter one. Echo Slam  Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️RC

Shockwaves travel through the ground, damaging enemy units. Each enemy hit causes an echo to damage nearby units. Real heroes cause two echoes.

The echo waves travel at a speed of 600.
Each enemy within the initial search radius sends echo waves toward other enemies within the echo search radius.
Hit enemy heroes send 2 echoes to every valid target within the radius, and not only to other heroes.
Treats clones as heroes, illusions and creep-heroes as creeps.
Does not affect wards and buildings.
The echo search radii are centered around each unit hit by the initial damage.
Echo waves are sent out to every enemy unit within the search radius, even if the target dies from the waves, except to the unit itself.
This means the echo waves targets can be up to 1400 range away from Earthshaker upon cast.
This also means when only one enemy is within the radius, it takes no damage, since it cannot send echoes to itself.
Fully affects invisible, untargetable units and units in the Fog of War.
Only the base damage fully affects  Couriers and sends out echo waves upon hit.
Can deal the following amount of damage  (before reductions) when hitting a certain amount of heroes, with no other units nearby:
2 Heroes: 280/360/440 ( 380/460/540) damage to each hero, 560/720/880 ( 760/920/1080) total damage.
3 Heroes: 460/580/700 ( 660/780/900) damage to each hero, 1380/1740/2100 ( 1980/2340/2700) total damage.

COSMETIC Has a cast backswing of 1.03 with the  Planetfall equipped.
A 10.5-second delay modifier is placed on every enemy damaged by Echo Slam, even without having Planetfall equipped.
If an enemy dies with this modifier, they are counted by the Arcana's kill counter for unlocking the Burning Descent style.
The kill effect modifier is applied on enemies killed by Echo Slam, which is responsible for the custom death effect of the Arcana.

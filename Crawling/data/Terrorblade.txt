modifier_terrorblade_reflection_slowAnyIn the fractal prison of Foulfell, Terrorblade learned the truth of this old tale: you are your own worst enemy. Now it is a lesson he teaches others.

     Reflection illusion as they appear to allies and enemies.  
Reflection slows all visible enemy heroes and clones within 500 radius, and creates illusions of them.
Treats clones and creep-heroes as creeps.
Reflection illusions have the following properties:
They are spell immune, invulnerable, hidden, untargetable and uncontrollable.
Visually distinguishable for everyone.
Have unobstructed movement with its movement speed set to 550.
Provide vision equal to the vision range of their target.
The Reflection-illusion spawns 108-distance from the affected enemy hero if the target's collision size is 27, and 72-distance if its collision size is 18.
The created illusion appears either north, east, south, or west from the target.
The illusions attempt to attack their targets. If they cannot be attacked, they follow the targets close enough until they can be attacked again.
The illusions do not lose track when their targets turn invisible, hidden or move into the Fog of War.
However, they do need vision to attack.
Just like other illusions, Reflection illusions bestow auras and can make use of other passive abilities that work for illusions.
The movement speed slow debuff and the illusion are bound to each other.
Dispelling the slow removes all the Reflection illusions of that unit as well.
Debuff of successive casts does not stack but creates an illusion for each enemy hero within range upon cast.
Although the movement speed slow duration gets refreshed, each created illusion has its separate duration, meaning new casts do not refresh the duration of previous illusions.
Leveling up the ability or the slow increasing  talent do not update the current active instance.
Has a cast backswing of 1.66 during  Metamorphosis. Conjure Image Link▶️WE

Ability Draft Notes:
Toggling Autocast on swaps this ability out with  Terror Wave. Their cooldowns are separate.
Temper, temper. The rage rises up and takes control. Meet Terrorblade's own worst self.


During the transformation, Terrorblade is prevented from acting and it cannot be interrupted.
This applies to transforming illusions as well.
Turns Terrorblade and all of his current illusions within  radius into a  ranged unit with 490/510/530/550 attack range for its duration.
This causes items that use different values for melee and ranged heroes (e.g.  Manta Style) to now treat the caster as a ranged hero.
Attack range bonuses are not overridden and still work normally.
Terrorblade's attack projectiles now travel at a speed of 900.
Grants flat base attack damage.
Fully benefits illusions, and is affected by every percentage-based base attack damage increasing or reducing effects.
Also sets his base attack time to 1.5.
However, since Terrorblade's base attack time is at 1.5 by default, this makes no difference for him and only affects casters with a different base attack time.
The aura affects illusions under Terrorblade's control, including invulnerable and hidden illusions. Its buff lingers for 1 seconds.
Does not affect illusions from other sources (e.g. an enemy  Reflection,  Haunt-based illusions, etc.).
While transformed, Terrorblade does not leave footprints behind. It also affects certain of his abilities' cast backswing.
Metamorphosis is fully canceled under the following conditions:
Upon death.
Upon casting  Demon Zeal.
SPELL STEAL Does not grant the attack range bonus. Transforms  Rubick into a lesser demon form and is fully canceled upon losing ability.
MORPH NOTES Fully canceled upon losing ability. Demon Zeal Link▶️DZ

Requires  Aghanim's Scepter to be unlocked.
If cast while in hero form, Terror Wave transforms Terrorblade into demon form for 10 seconds, based on the current level of  Metamorphosis.
Metamorphosis notes fully apply. If it is not learned or if the caster does not have Metamorphosis, the caster does not transform.
If cast while already in Metamorphosis, its duration gets extended by the same value instead.
Successive casts increase the current Metamorphosis buff duration. There is no limit to how often this can be done.
The wave is released 0.6 seconds after cast, starting at the original cast location. It does not follow Terrorblade.
Terror Wave is a thin ring expanding outwards at a speed of 1000, taking 1.6 seconds to reach the maximum radius.
It can be avoided by teleporting towards Terrorblade over the ring shortly after cast.
Terror Wave's fear makes affected enemies run away from the caster, rather than make them run toward their team's fountain.
Despite the tooltip, the fear affects any unit, not just heroes.
The cast sound is global and audible to the enemy through the Fog of War.
Metamorphosis is fully canceled under the following conditions:
Upon death.
Upon casting  Demon Zeal.
SPELL STEAL Fully grants all of  Metamorphosis' ability effects upon transforming and the lesser demon form persists upon losing ability. Sunder  Link▶️RR

Both Terrorblade and the affected target's health will always end up with at least 35%/30%/25% of their max health.
For example, if both targets have 5% health before Sunder, then they both end up at 35%/30%/25% thereafter.
This counts as setting health.
SOULBIND Terrorblade first receives the primary target's current health, then the primary target receives the secondary target's current health, and then the secondary target receives Terrorblade's current health.

The projectile travels at a speed of 2500.
Assassinate first applies the spell damage, the instant attack, then the debuff.
Although the stun duration is set to 0.01 seconds, it lasts 0.033 seconds due to the server tick rate limit.
Assassinate places a debuff on the target as soon as Sniper begins casting.
The debuff lasts 4 seconds, or until the projectile lands, or the cast gets canceled.
Grants shared vision with the targeted unit. Does not provide any vision when targeting neutral creeps.
Also, it grants True Sight over the target, meaning it cannot be canceled or be disjointed with invisibility without True Sight immunity.
The debuff is visible to everyone. The crosshair above the target is visible to allies only.
Can directly target invulnerable units, and does not get canceled if the target turns invulnerable during the cast time.
The vision debuff is not placed when targeting an invulnerable unit but stays if the unit turns invulnerable during the cast time.
The projectile does not affect the target if it is still invulnerable on impact.
Cannot target hidden units and gets canceled when the target turns hidden.
Assassinate has an increased cast range buffer of 600, instead of using the default 250.
This means once the cast animation begins, the target has to move at least 3600 range away from Sniper to be considered out of range.

The instant attack can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects. It has True Strike, but completely ignore disarms.

Only resets Assassinate's cooldown and does not reset any other abilities.

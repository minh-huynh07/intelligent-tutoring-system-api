Places a frozen hex on an enemy unit that deals damage over time, but can be dispelled by moving away from the initial cast point. If the enemy unit doesn't move out of the given range, it will be stunned and frozen in place after 4 seconds.

modifier_ancientapparition_coldfeet_freezeStrongKaldr's presence draws those around him into a frozen void, threatening to lock them in an icy prison for eternity.


Cold Feet places an initial debuff on the affected target and places an icy marker at its current position upon cast.
As long as the target stays within 715 ( 1015) radius of the mark, it takes damage from the debuff and after 4 seconds it is stunned.
If the target moves 715 ( 1015) range away from the mark at any point during the initial debuff, the ability completely stops, removing the debuff and the marker.
This means even when the target moves back within range, it is not frozen or damaged further.
Also considers the target's vertical position, getting moved far up enough can stop Cold Feet as well.
Successive casts on units that already have the Cold Feet modifier do not stack and do nothing.
Deals 15/25/35/45 ( 35/45/55/65) damage in 0.5-second intervals, starting immediately upon cast, resulting in 8 instances.
The stun is then applied 1 second after the last instance.
Can deal up to 120/200/280/360 ( 280/360/440/520) damage to the target (before reductions).
TALENT Both damage per second increasing and break distance increasing  talents does not update the current instance of already placed Cold Feet debuffs.
The area of effect  talent turns Cold Feet into an area-targeted ability with 450 radius, so that it cannot directly target units anymore.
The break distances are different for each hit enemy. They do not share it.
Fully affects invisible enemies and enemies inside the Fog of War. Ice Vortex Link▶️WE

modifier_chilling_touch_slowAnyThe Ancient Apparition's eternal knowledge brings a frigid enchantment to his attacks.


The cast range equals the caster's attack range and the bonus attack range from the ability.
It can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. However, it is not affected by cast range bonuses.
For Ancient Apparition, the total range for this ability is 735/795/855/915 ( 1035/1095/1155/1215).
The bonus damage is applied as spell damage in a separate damage instance, it is affected by spell damage amplification and works with spell lifesteal.
Debuffs from successive casts fully stack, with each instance creating its own debuff.
The attacks first apply the debuff, the spell damage, then the attack damage.
Does not work against allied units, buildings, or wards. Ice Blast Link▶️RT



AbilityTarget Point
AffectsEnemies
DamageMagical  /  Instant Kill

Launches a tracer towards any location of the battlefield, which must be triggered again to mark the area to be blasted by a damaging explosion of hail. The further the tracer travels, the larger the explosion will be. Enemies caught in the explosion, or who touched the icy ball of hail as it travels, are frostbitten, taking damage and prevented from regenerating or healing. If a frostbitten unit's health drops below a certain percentage, they will instantly shatter.

Upon cast, Ice Blast is replaced by the  Release sub-ability.
The tracer projectile travels at a speed of 1500 until Release is cast, Ancient Apparition dies, or it reaches the map boundaries.
The tracer projectile itself is harmless. It neither deals damage nor places the debuff.
The tracer is visible to allies only. The initial cast sound is also only audible to allies.
The explosion radius starts at 275 and increases by 50 for every second the tracer has traveled, capped at 1000 radius.
Thus, it takes at least 15 seconds to reach the maximum radius, equaling 22500 units traveled.
The tracer provides 500 radius flying vision around itself as it travels. This vision does not last.
The debuff is only placed on heroes.
Treats clones and creep-heroes as heroes, and illusions as creeps.
The debuff can also be placed on spell immune or invulnerable units, but not on hidden units.
Unlike the debuff, the explosion damage hits all enemy units, including creeps, excluding buildings and wards.
The debuff freezes health and prevents the following current health increasing effects:
Flat current health sources.
Percentage-based current health sources.
Current health increase from  strength items and/or from health bonus items.
 Granite Aura
However, the debuff does not prevent the following sources from increasing health:
Setting health sources.
Max health increasing sources.
From losing the  Whirling Death debuff.
From gaining/losing the  Decay buff/debuff.
Units affected by the debuff die instantly when their current health drops below the threshold.
The debuff checks the unit's health upon taking damage, excluding damage flagged by HP removal.
The kill is credited to the source of the damage which brought them below the threshold.
However, if it was caused by self-inflicted damage, Ancient Apparition is credited instead.
Has a lower priority than  Winter's Curse, so if affected by both, Winter's Curse takes priority.
Has a higher priority than  Reaper's Scythe, so if affected by both, Ice Blast takes priority.
The following sources prevent affected units from dying while below the kill threshold:
Min health (e.g.  Shallow Grave).
Invulnerability
The debuff deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after the debuff is applied, resulting in 10 instances.
The debuff itself can deal up to Lua error in Module:Calculate at line 59: bad argument #2 to 'gsub' (string/function/table expected). damage (before reductions).
Together with the explosion, Ice Blast can deal up to Lua error in Module:Calculate at line 59: bad argument #2 to 'gsub' (string/function/table expected). damage.
SHARD Now applies the  Cold Feet debuff based on its current level on all hit heroes, with a reduced stun duration of 0.96/1.2/1.44/1.68 seconds.
Cold Feet applied by Ice Blast do not cost any mana, and are applied even if the ability itself is not castable.
Cold Feet notes fully apply. If it is not leveled, no debuffs are applied.
TALENT The area of effect  talent does not upgrade these passively applied Cold Feets. Release Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️RT

Releases the ice blast to explode at the tracer's current location.

Replaces  Ice Blast until the sub-ability is used or the tracer disappears.
Upon cast, the tracer stops traveling and marks the total area hit by the explosion once the main projectile reaches its position.
The tracer then provides a 4-second 650 radius flying vision at that position.
The Ice Blast projectile travels at a speed of 750, or reaches the targeted point 1.75 seconds after launch, whichever is faster.
The projectile is only released when the sub-ability is cast, or when Ancient Apparition dies while the tracer is still traveling.
It is not released when the tracer reaches the map boundary. In this case, the ability is wasted.
Every enemy unit that comes within 275 radius of the projectile as it travels, or is hit by the explosion, gets the frostbitten debuff.
The debuff starts expiring only once outside of the range of the projectile. Getting within range again immediately refreshes the duration.
The projectile is fully visible to enemies and provides a 3-second 500-radius flying vision as it travels.
However unlike the tracer, it is not visible on the minimap.
Ancient Apparition is unable to level Ice Blast up while this sub-ability is active.
SPELL STEAL Grants  Ice Blast if this sub-ability is the last cast ability.

Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
Upgrades Tinker's Laser into a Shrink Ray, granting +200 cast range and reducing the main target's size and current health by 10% (stacking) if it's a hero. The laser bounces once on the farthest target up to 700 range from the primary one, prioritizing heroes.

modifier_tinker_laser_blindAnyBoush perfected this rock cutting laser in his subterranean laboratory, never considering its combat utility.


During the cast time, Laser's sound effect is audible and the ability animation is visible to everyone.
The area damage only hits visible enemies. Does not hit invisible and enemies inside the Fog of War.
The laser first applies the blind debuff, then the health reduction debuff, then the damage to the primary target.
SCEPTER With enough valid targets, it is possible for Laser to apply its ability effects in different orders.
Multiple instances of the debuff do not stack.
Blind uses pseudo-random distribution.
Stacks additively with other blind sources up to 100% and multiplicatively with evasion sources.
The blind duration treats creep-heroes as creeps.
SCEPTER Laser now bounces to the furthest enemy within 700 radius of its current target.
Laser has no bounce delay, so all targets are hit at the same time.
Can only bounce to heroes, clones, creep-heroes and illusions.
If the primary target is a non-hero unit, it still bounces to valid targets within the search radius.
Does not bounce on invisible or enemies inside in the Fog of War.
The bounced laser deals its area damage as well.
SCEPTER Laser also reduces the targets' current and max health by 10%.
Treats the  Spirit Bear as a hero. Treats other creep-heroes and  Roshan as creeps.
The lower the target's current health is, the less current health they lose through the reduction, while the maximum health reduction stays constant.
Also reduces the target's model size by 10%. This has no impact on collision size.
Upon losing the debuff, the target's model size and max health are reverted, while their current health stays the same.
Both the health and the model size reduction are applied by the same modifier as the blind debuff, and multiple instances of the debuff now stack. March of the Machines  WT

Targets an allied unit, applying a barrier to them that blocks some damage and provides Status Resistance.

↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
Fully affects ally  Couriers.
Applies a  Universal damage barrier on the affected target that absorbs damage values of all damage types (after all reductions), causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity.
Stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources.
Universal damage barrier has the lowest priority in the group of damage barriers, its capacity is depleted last when combined with other damage-type barriers.
However, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g.  Borrowed Time or  Refraction), Defense Matrix does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire.
Successive casts do not stack but refresh the duration and reset the damage barrier capacity.
Stacks multiplicatively with other status resistance sources.
TALENT
The damage barrier capacity increasing  talent does not affect any of the current active instances.
The cooldown reduction bonus granting  talent stacks multiplicatively with other percentage-based cooldown reduction sources, and is calculated after all flat cooldown reduction values. Warp Flare   Link▶️Link▶️DD

Ability Draft Notes:
Keen Conveyance is granted to the player that drafted  Rearm.
As Boush likes to say, 'There is nothing the arcane can accomplish that the curious mind cannot reproduce given time. And proper funding, of course.'


If the channeling is interrupted, the ability does nothing, and goes into cooldown while consuming mana.
↓↓ Double-tapping the ability while being at least 1500 range away from the team's fountain, automatically targets the fountain.
When ground-targeted, it automatically searches for the closest valid target for Tinker to teleport to.
At Level 1, Keen Conveyance can only target buildings. Level 2 can target non-hero units as well, and level 3 can target allied heroes as well.
Treats the  Spirit Bear as a hero. Treats other creep-heroes as creeps.
Cannot directly target buildings. Instead, it uses the minimum teleport distance.
Disjoints projectiles upon teleporting.
During the channeling, the teleport destination is marked with a visual effect in the same color as the player, and a sound is played.
The sound and visual effects are visible and audible to everyone.
The visual effect is also visible while teleporting to invisible allies.
Also marks the point on the minimap for allies. The mark is in the player's color and lasts as long as the channeling does.
Provides 200 range flying vision at the destination point for 4.5 seconds, even if the channeling is canceled. The vision lingers for 1 second.
The targeted unit's priority is lowered, meaning it is attacked as the last auto-attack target by other units.
When the targeted unit dies or changes ownership (e.g.  Enchant) during the channeling, the teleport gets canceled, wasting the cooldown and mana cost.
Since buildings are not directly targeted, the destruction of the building or loss of Outposts does not cancel the teleport. Rearm Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️RR

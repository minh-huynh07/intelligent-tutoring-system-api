modifier_phantom_assassin_stiflingdaggerAnyThe first skill learned by the Sisters of the Veil often signals an incoming hit.


The Stifling Dagger travels at a speed of 1200.
Upon projectile hit, the dagger has a 34% ( 41%) chance to proc the  Coup de Grace buff and causes Phantom Assassin to perform an instant attack on the target.
These instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally (except  Tidebringer). They have True Strike and completely ignore disarms.
Cleave effects are based on the target's position, damaging a trapezoid area in the opposite direction where the dagger came from.
Although the dagger may make it look like a ranged attack, the attack still counts as a  melee attack when its coming from Phantom Assassin.
This causes all abilities (and items) that use different values for melee and ranged heroes (e.g.  Skull Basher), to use their melee effects and values, not ranged.
If the caster is a  ranged hero, the instant attacks do not use attack projectiles and are instant, but still count as ranged attacks.
Stifling Dagger's instant attack first applies the self-total outgoing attack damage multiplier, then grants unique flat bonus attack damage upon the projectile hit.
The total attack damage includes all already existing attack damage changes, including conditional bonus sources (e.g. Bash and Quell).
This can be defined as expr ΣAtk × 30%/45%/60%/75% ( 50%/65%/80%/95%) + 65/70/75/80
Applies the bonus attack damage only to the Stifling Dagger projectile.
Therefore, attack damage based attack modifiers (e.g. critical strike, lifesteal, cleave) include the 30%/45%/60%/75% instant attack damage bonus as well.
Since the damage comes from a regular attack, it counts as attack damage and not as spell damage.
It is affected by damage block, but unaffected by spell damage amplification and cannot spell lifesteal.
The projectile first applies the attack, then its own debuff.
The projectile has 450 range flying vision that lingers for 3.34 seconds at the target's location upon successfully hitting it.
Cannot be cast on  Couriers.
COSMETIC
Has a cast backswing of 0.67 with the  Exile Unveiled equipped.
Has a cast backswing of 0.8 with the  Manifold Paradox equipped.
TALENT Stifling Dagger now launches 2 additional projectiles towards random visible valid targets within the range.
The search range is based on the cast range and the buffer range, resulting in a search range of 1000/1150/1300/1450.
The search range is centered around the primary target, not around Phantom Assassin, so when no other targets are nearby, nothing happens.
The secondary targets are chosen randomly within the area. There are no priorities. The projectiles cannot choose both the same target.
Since the additional projectiles use the ability's cast range, cast range-increasing effects increase their range as well. Phantom Strike  Link▶️WB

Requires  Aghanim's Shard to be unlocked.
Applies Break on hit enemies.
Despite the visual effect, Fan of Knives releases a single pulse that expands outwards, hitting all enemies as it reaches them.
The released daggers only have a visual purpose, the pulse affects all enemies it catches, regardless of the number of visible daggers.
The pulse spreads at a speed of 1000 and takes 0.55 seconds to reach max range.
The area of effect is centered around the cast location, it does not move along with the caster.
The pulse is not a ring. It affects every enemy within its expanding area of effect.
This means it is not possible to avoid the effect by blinking over the daggers/pulse toward the caster.

The attack that consumed the buff may also proc another buff instance, making consecutive critical strikes possible.

Attacking against allied units, buildings and wards will consume the buff.
Attacking against items and runes will not comsume the buff.
If another source of critical strike procs on the same attack as Coup de Grace, the crit with the higher multiplier takes priority.

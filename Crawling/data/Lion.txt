The spikes' max travel distance is based on the cast range, plus the range buffer.
With the default cast range, it has a max travel distance of 925.
The spikes travel at a speed of 2000, taking 0.46 seconds to travel the full distance.
With the travel distance and the spikes radius, it can hit units up to 1065 range away.
When unit-targeted, the spikes are released towards their current location upon cast. Spikes do not home and thus can be evaded.
Hit units are knocked up 350 range for the initial 0.5 seconds of the stun.
While in the air, other units may pass below hit airborne units.
The spike that hits the target is larger and is elevated. This visual effect can also be seen in the Fog of War.
When Earth Spike hits invisible units, the visual effects below the hit unit are still visible.
The damage is applied upon landing, not upon getting hit.
When interrupted, the damage will be applied prematurely.
TALENT The Earth Spike cone  talent launches 2 spikes with the primary cast.
The extra spikes are launched with a 30° angle to the left and right of the primary spike in the center.

Lesser magi are nothing more than a source of magical restoration for the Demon Witch.


Can only be cast on units that have mana pool.
The link breaks on the target in the following conditions:
When the target gets out of vision, turns invulnerable or hidden.
This includes becoming invisible with True Sight immunity.
Upon the target's death.
When it exceeds the 1100 ( 1300) break distance.
The effective area for the link break distance is half of a sphere and not a flat circle. Therefore, the link can be broken with upward movement sources as well.
The link still affects the target and does not break, even when the target(s) run out of mana, enter the Fog of War, turns untargetable or invisible.
The mana replenished is based on how much the target actually lost per interval. If they have no mana left, no mana is gained either.
When Lion is at full mana, the enemy target is still damaged and continues to lose mana.
Grants the following bonuses when casting on allies:
7.5%/10%/12.5%/15% ( 12.5%/15%/17.5%/20%) movement speed bonus.
Restores 10/20/30/60 mana per second and up to 50/100/150/300 for the entire channeling duration.
While restoring the ally's mana, it works the same as well with reversed effects, the mana replenished to the ally is based on how much mana Lion loses.

Replenishes the allied illusion's mana and does not destroy them.
The damage values are affected by mana loss manipulation sources.
Provides True Sight over the target(s) for its duration.

Deals the same amount of damage using the same intervals, and resulting in the same amount of damage instances.
Instantly destroys targeted illusions on the first interval, and does not drain mana from enemy illusions.
Treats strong illusion as heroes.
SHARD Mana Drain now affects 2 additional random enemy targets, prioritizing heroes, within 1050 search radius centered on Lion.
Does not consider units without mana as additional targets.
Since the additional links use the ability's cast range, cast range increasing effects increase its search range as well.
For secondary targets, the link only breaks on the target(s) in the following conditions:
When the channeling on the primary target is interrupted in any way.
Upon the secondary target's death, or upon exceeding the break distance.
The secondary links stop draining mana and damaging their target(s), if they enter the Fog of War, or when they are affected by invisibility, with or without true sight immunity. In any case, Mana Drain continues to apply its movement speed slow.
SHARD The debuff immunity granting upgrade does not dispel Lion.
Stacks multiplicatively with other  magic resistance sources.

With the magic resistance bonus from this source, every 10 points of  intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 0.4%. [?]
TALENT The movement speed slow increasing  talent also increases the ally movement speed bonus.
Does not update the current active instance.
SOULBIND  Mana Drain requires a minimum of 4 targets to work. Casting ability on either the primary or the secondary target without the minimum required targets are considered as canceling the channeling. Finger of Death  Link▶️Link▶️RF

Modifiers [?]
modifier_enigma_maleficeAny
modifier_stunnedStrongAbility Draft Notes:
 Demonic Summoning must be drafted for  Eidolons to be created.
Strange gravities pull at the core of those who would oppose you, holding them in place.


The first instance occurs upon cast, and then every 2 seconds.
On each interval, Malefice first applies the damage, then the stun.
SHARD
Malefice now creates a  Lesser Eidolon based on the current level of  Demonic Summoning per stun instance. Can create a maximum of 3 ( 7) Lesser Eidolons for its duration.
Lesser Eidolons created this way cannot multiply but their duration is still refreshed after its 7th attack projectile launch.
Demonic Summoning notes fully apply. If it is not leveled, no Eidolons are created.
Can deal up to 165/210/255/300 ( 270/315/360/405) damage (before reductions).
TALENT With the number of instances increasing  talent, it can deal up to 385/490/595/700 damage.
With both  talents, it can deal up to 630/735/840/945 damage.
Can stun for up to 0.9/1.5/2.1/2.7 ( 1.8/2.4/3/3.6) seconds in total.
TALENT With the number of instances increasing  talent, it can stun for up to 2.1/3.5/4.9/6.3 ( 4.2/5.6/7/8.4) seconds in total.
Successive casts do not stack but refresh the duration and continue damaging in the same intervals as the first cast.
SPELL STEAL   Lesser Eidolon summoned are based on  Enigma's current ability level when acquired. Demonic Summoning  Link▶️WC

Summons three fragments of Enigma himself at the cost of health. These eidolons are all under Enigma's control, and repeated successful attacks cause them to multiply. When this happens, the eidolons have their health restored.

Does not instantly kill the previous summons if this ability is used again before the previous  Eidolons expire.
The Eidolons spawned are always in the same formation, 0° facing east.
Upon cast, Demonic Summoning spawns three groups of Eidolons with 1 Eidolon in each group, 100 range away from the targeted position to its right, left, and backside.
COSMETIC  Geodesic Eidolons spawn instantly regardless of its spawn animations.
TALENT The number of Eidolons increasing  talent still spawn three groups of Eidolons in the same formation.
The left and right group each have 3 Eidolons, while the group at the backside has 2 Eidolons.
Only attacking the following units count toward the first 6 attacks required to multiply:
Heroes, clones, creep-heroes and creeps.
Ward-type units.
Neither count attacks against buildings nor ally units.
The attack is counted upon projectile launch, not upon projectile hit. Therefore, it does not matter whether the attack actually hits the target or not.
Eidolons multiply upon their 7th attack projectile launch, regardless of whether the attacked target is a valid one (e.g. while attacking a building).
When multiplying, the original summoned Eidolon's health created from the ability is refreshed by setting health, then it creates new Eidolons that cannot multiply.
Since Eidolon(s) multiplying is not considered as death, buffs and debuffs are neither dispelled, nor projectiles are disjointed.
The original summoned Eidolons' duration is also not refreshed when multiplying.
However, the newly created Eidolon's duration gets increased by 2 seconds.
The Eidolon's name progresses as follows per Demonic Summoning level: Lesser Eidolon ➜ Eidolon ➜ Greater Eidolon ➜ Dire Eidolon.
Current health as cost is considered as setting health and it is non-lethal. Therefore, this ability can be cast even with 1 health.
TALENT Both the attack speed increasing and attack damage increasing  talents immediately update all currently spawned Eidolons. Midnight Pulse Link▶️ED

Fully disables all enemies within the inner effect radius and silences them.
Spirals affected units counterclockwise towards the center at a speed of 30, resulting in a maximum possible distance of 120.
The closer the units are to the center, the stronger they get pulled to the center, with almost no pull, but only rotation at max close distance.
Therefore, the inner radius spirals the affected heroes at 14.32° per second, while the outer radius spirals the affected heroes at 5.73° per second. [?]
Can pull affected units over impassable terrain and through trees without destroying them.
Units inside Black Hole can be pulled out by various abilities.
However, the following abilities or items cannot move units out of Black Hole:  Force Staff,  Hurricane Pike,  Snowball,  Dispose and  Geomagnetic Grip.
The pull and disable are provided by an aura, which lingers for 0.5 seconds, or until the channeling stops, whichever is shorter.
Does not affect wards or buildings, but fully affects  Couriers.
Provides 800 range ground vision at the targeted point for 4 seconds upon cast.
Deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after cast, resulting in 4 instances.
Can deal up to 400/600/800 ( 600/800/1000) +  14% of max health as damage (before reductions).
SCEPTER The max health as damage is added to the main damage and dealt together in one instance.
 Roshan can only be affected by the base damage per second.
SCEPTER Black Hole now also spirals enemies within a 1200 radius counterclockwise in at a speed of 175, resulting in a maximum possible distance of 700.
The pull towards the center gets stronger the closer the affected units are to it.
However, unlike the pull within the main area, this pull spirals much weaker and goes more toward the center.
SCEPTER The outer pull is provided by a separate aura, which also lingers for 0.5 seconds, or until the channeling stops, whichever is shorter.
This aura does not affect enemies that are affected by the main Black Hole modifier.
Affects the  Tree Dance unit, but does not unperch it.
Pull affected enemies over impassable terrain, but does not grant unobstructed movement.
Does not pull affected enemies when they are affected by other disabling forced movement sources.
Does not impede affected enemies at all and they can still turn, attack, and cast abilities.

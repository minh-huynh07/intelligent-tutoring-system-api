Ability Draft Notes:
Devour only grants passive abilities of devoured neutral creeps (except for  Dragonhide Aura), active abilities are not gained. The passive abilities are gained in the form of status buffs. Devour's cooldown is not reset by  Rearm.
Lucifer's appetite and greed are never sated.

Alt-Cast Icon
Upon leveling Devour for the first time, it has Alt-cast activated by default, which enables acquiring abilities of neutral creeps.
The acquired abilities' levels are based on the current level of Devour at the time of acquisition and levels up accordingly based on the Neutral Upgrade interval.
These abilities appear in the dedicated  Fourth and  Fifth ability slot.
Cannot devour  Roshan,  Couriers, wards, creep-heroes, and ancient creeps.
TALENT Devour's ancient creeps targeting restriction is removed upon learning the  talent.
The following creeps cannot be devoured due to the level restriction:
LEVEL 4 Can devour all creeps.
LEVEL 3 Can devour all creeps.
LEVEL 2 Cannot devour:  Ancient Black Dragon,  Ancient Granite Golem,  Ancient Ice Shaman,  Ancient Thunderhide,  Dark Troll Summoner,  Satyr Tormenter,
LEVEL 1 Additionally cannot devour:  Alpha Wolf,  Ancient Frostbitten Golem,  Ancient Rock Golem,  Ancient Rumblehide,  Centaur Conqueror,  Hellbear Smasher,  Mega Ranged Creep,  Necronomicon Archer,  Necronomicon Warrior,  Ranged Creep,  Super Ranged Creep,  Warpine Raider,  Wildwing Ripper,
The targeted creep is instantly killed upon cast, granting its bounty and experience like a regular last hit.
Then it applies the Devour buff on self, granting its armor and magic resistance bonus, then grants unreliable gold when the buff expires.
TALENT Stacks multiplicatively with other  magic resistance sources.
Increases Doom's magic resistance to 36.25%.
With the magic resistance bonus from this source, every 10 points of  intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 0.85%. [?]
Despite the ability description stating that the duration is equal to the ability's cooldown, cooldown reduction sources affect the ability's cooldown but not the duration.
Successive casts fully stack with each instance having its own independent buff duration.

The Fallen One spreads destruction in his wake, sparing none from the flame which sustains him.


Scorched Earth's radius is centered on Doom for its duration.
The movement speed bonus is provided by an aura and lingers for 0.5 seconds.
However, the damage and heal per second component is independent of the aura.
The ability's visual effect disappears while hidden or invulnerable, and Scorched Earth stops applying its damage and heal per second.
Deals damage and heal in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after cast, resulting in up to 10/12/14/16 possible instances.
Can deal up to 200/420/700/1040 ( 320/564/868/1232) damage to a single enemy within the radius for the entire duration (before reductions).
Leveling up the ability does not update the current instance.
TALENT However, the damage increasing  talent immediately updates the damage and heal per second of the current instance.
Both leveling up and the movement speed increasing  talent does not update the movement speed bonus of the current instance.
Successive casts do not stack but refresh the ability values and duration.
SHARD Acquiring the  Ability Upgrade does not update the current active instance.
Always heal Doom and his player-controlled units for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much damage the target actually takes.
The healing value is not based on the damage dealt. Therefore, spell amplification sources can not affect the heal value.
The heal can be affected by lifesteal manipulation source but not heal manipulation.
Can heal up to 120/252/420/624 ( 192/338.4/520.8/739.2) for the entire duration. Infernal Blade  Link▶️EV

Infernal Blade's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. However, it is not affected by cast range bonuses.
Both Autocast and manually casting it uses Doom's current attack range.
Only works with regular attacks. Instant attacks cannot trigger Infernal Blade.
Cannot be cast on  Roshan.
Deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after the debuff is applied, resulting in 4 instances.
Can deal up to 80/120/160/200 + 4%/8%/12%/16% ( 12%/16%/20%/24%) of the target's max health as damage (before reductions).
Successive casts on the same target fully stack and its debuff works independently.
Both leveling up the ability and the max health as damage increasing  talent does not update the damage of the current instances.
Infernal Blade first applies the bash, the burn debuff, then the attack damage.
Stacks with other bash sources, with its duration following the regular rule of stuns — the longer one overrides the shorter one. Devoured Ability 1 DF

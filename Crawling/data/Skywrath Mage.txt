Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
When Skywrath Mage casts Arcane Bolt, 3 bolts are created, one aimed at the original target, and the rest - at random enemies within 700 range of the original target. Heroes will take priority.

The bolt travels at a speed of 500.
The projectile has a 325 radius flying vision. This vision does not linger.
Also provides the same vision at the target's location for 3.34 seconds upon successfully hitting it.
Checks Skywrath Mage's  intelligence upon releasing the projectile.
This means that the projectile's damage is set upon launch and does not adapt when losing or gaining intelligence.
This is how much damage Arcane Bolt deals with a certain amount of intelligence (before reductions):
LEVEL 1 (23 ): 110/130/150/170 damage
LEVEL 5 (39 ): 134/154/174/194 damage
LEVEL 10 (59 ): 165/185/205/225 damage
LEVEL 15 (80 ): 196/216/236/256 damage
LEVEL 20 (100 ): 226/246/266/286 damage
LEVEL 25 (121 ): 257/277/297/317 damage
LEVEL 30 (141 ): 288/308/328/348 damage

Arcane Bolt first deals the damage, then applies the debuff.
The spell lifesteal value of successive casts on the same target does not stack but refreshes the duration.
SCEPTER Whenever Arcane Bolt is cast, 3 different random targets within the search radius, prioritizing heroes, are also targeted by other Arcane Bolts.
The search radius is centered around the primary target, not around Skywrath Mage.
Since it uses a defined radius and is not based on the cast range, it is not affected by cast range modifying abilities (e.g.  Aether Lens).
Treats clones and illusions as heroes and creep-heroes as creeps.
The other Arcane Bolts are released only if valid targets are found within the search radius.
TALENT Fully affects  Couriers upon learning the Arcane Bolt pierces spell immunity  talent.
SOULBIND Considers the extra Arcane Bolt casts of the  Ability Upgrade as being unit-targeted directly by Skywrath Mage. This means that if both bounded heroes are targeted by the first set of bolts, a total of 3 sets of bolts will be cast. Concussive Shot  Link▶️Link▶️WT

modifier_alchemist_acid_sprayUndispellableUsing traditional Alchemy from the Darkbrew family, Razzil concocts an acid that dissolves even the toughest metals.


Both the armor reduction and ally armor increasing bonus are provided by an aura, its debuff lingers for 0.5 seconds.
The damage is independent of the aura, and the damage of multiple instances of Acid Spray fully stacks.
However, the enemy armor reduction and ally armor bonus value does not.
Deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting immediately upon cast, resulting in up to 16 instances.
Can deal up to 400/480/560/640 damage to a single unit (before reductions).
When leveling up the ability while a cast is already active, the armor reduction value on already affected units does not update to the new value.
However, if an enemy receives the debuff after leveling it up, that enemy receives the new armor reduction value.
The damage value does not update and is always based on the level the ability was cast on.
TALENT The armor reduction notes fully apply to the ally armor bonus  talent.
Grants allies within the radius 4/5/6/7 ( 5/6/7/8) bonus armor.

Alchemist brews up an unstable concoction that he can throw at an enemy hero, to stun and deal damage in an area around the explosion. The longer the concoction brews, the more damage it deals and the longer the stun. Alchemist is faster while charging the concoction. After 5 seconds, the brew reaches its maximum damage and stun time. However, after 5.5 seconds, the concoction will explode on Alchemist himself if not thrown.

Interrupts Alchemist's channeling abilities upon cast.
A timer above Alchemist's head shows how much time is left before the concoction blows up. This timer is visible to everyone.
While brewing the concoction, Alchemist has increased movement speed, and he can move around and act freely.
The increased movement speed buff lasts until the  Unstable Concoction Throw sub-ability is used or the concoction blows up.
The brewing animation and particles are visible to everyone. The Unstable Concoction buff is hidden.
The sound can be heard by enemies only when the ability is cast within their vision range.
The damage starts at 0 and increases by 3.6/4.6/6.2/7.6 ( 11.6/12.6/14.2/15.6) per 0.1 seconds brewed, reaching the full damage in 5 seconds.
The stun duration starts at 0.25 seconds and increases by 0.029/0.039/0.049/0.059 for each 0.1 seconds brewed, reaching 1.7/2.2/2.7/3.2 in 5 seconds.
The concoction first applies the damage, then the debuff.
Unstable Concoction always affects a 350 ( 475) radius around where it explodes, including when it explodes on Alchemist.
When Alchemist dies while brewing, it instantly blows up, damaging enemy units around Alchemist based on the brewed duration.
The self-inflicted damage is lethal, it can be used to deny oneself.
TALENT Both the radius increasing and the maximum damage increasing  talents immediately updates all of Alchemist's currently brewing concoction and all of his currently flying concoction projectiles.

If Alchemist kills another unit which yields gold within the next 40 seconds, an additional instance of Extra Bonus Gold is added to the total. Additionally, causes bounty runes to yield more gold.

While it is not a mountain, Razzil has mastered the conversion of smaller compounds to line his pockets.


This is innate to Alchemist and does not need to be learned.
Greevil's Greed triggers and grants a stack on every last hit Alchemist makes on units that have a death gold bounty, except for buildings, illusions, and the  Tempest Double.
Denies or last hits from his player-controlled units do not add to the current stack.
Does not trigger on units that have Reincarnation as well, except for  Wraith King Skeletons.
All stacks work fully independently from each other. They last 40 seconds each and do not refresh each other.
The status buff icon shows how much extra Gold  Alchemist gains on his next last hit.
A second bounty number appears over Alchemist, showing the amount of extra gold earned. This number is only visible to Alchemist.
TALENT Grants flat bonus attack damage per stack, values displayed on the HUD are rounded up.
11 last hits is required to reach the gold bonus and bonus attack damage cap within the 40-second stack duration.
Grants unreliable gold bonus from last hits.
Grants reliable gold bonus from the  Bounty Rune multiplier.

Ability Draft Notes:
Requires drafting  Greevil's Greed to be unlocked, instead of being innate to Alchemist.However,  Chemical Rage must be drafted as well for the bonus attack damage and bonus spell amplification component to work.



This is innate to Alchemist, despite  Chemical Rage's in-game ability upgrade tooltip.
 Aghanim's Scepter has an active ability for Alchemist, allowing him to cast it on ally heroes.
Treats clones and illusions as creeps.
↓↓ Double-tapping Aghanim's Scepter in the inventory automatically targets self.
Once cast, the Scepter is consumed and the target ally passively receives all of  Aghanim's Scepter's upgrades, as well as the item's attributes:
10  all stats.
175 health and 175 mana.
The 4200  net worth of the item transfers from Alchemist to the target hero. Self-casting does not change the net worth.
Doing so does not change Alchemist's or the target's GPM.
A hero can only be targeted once by Aghanim's Scepter Synth.
If the target ally bought Aghanim's Scepter and has it in their inventory or backpack, it gets refunded, removing it and granting them 4200 .
If the target ally already has  Aghanim's Blessing or  Aghanim's Blessing - Roshan consumed, it gets refunded as well, granting them 5800 .
It does not matter how the target acquired Aghanim's Blessing, the gold is always refunded to the target ally by Alchemist, except when targeting himself.
Gold refunded this way is granted as unreliable gold.
The number of stacks and amount of bonuses gained can be seen on the status buff icon. Grants the following bonuses to Alchemist upon cast on ally heroes:
Flat bonus attack damage.
Generic bonus outgoing damage amplification.
Stacks additively with other sources of generic outgoing damage manipulation.
Affects only spell damage sourced to Alchemist. Does not amplify damage flagged as HP removal.
Since up to 4 allies and Alchemist himself can be infused, Alchemist can gain up to 125 attack damage and 25% spell damage amplification bonus.

modifier_slowedAnyAbility Draft Notes:
 Jinada has to be drafted as well for it to get applied.
While the shuriken may be small, Gondar's precise aim can cause critical damage.


The shuriken travels at a speed of 1000.
The shuriken first applies the damage, then the debuff, then Jinada's spell damage.
The initial target does not have to be  Tracked for the shuriken to bounce.
Can only bounce to each Tracked unit once.
Can also bounce to different Track debuff sources as long as the debuff is applied by an ally.
Cannot bounce to, but can bounce off of invulnerable or hidden units.
Can deal up to the following amount of damage (before reductions) to Tracked targets per Track level:
LEVEL 1 140/210/280/350 damage.
LEVEL 2 170/255/340/425 damage.
LEVEL 3 200/300/400/500 damage.

Both leveling up the ability and the slow duration  talent immediately upgrades all of Bounty Hunter's currently flying shurikens.
SCEPTER Shuriken Toss now applies the current level of  Jinada on its target upon projectile impact.
Jinada notes fully apply. If it is not leveled, it is not applied.
Does not use instant attacks to apply the Jinada. The effects are applied by Shuriken Toss itself.
Shuriken Toss' Jinada is independent of the Jinada applied by attacks, regardless of cooldown, and works even when dead.
The 60/100/140/180 ( 90/130/170/210) damage is applied as spell damage in a separate damage instance, it is affected by spell damage amplification and works with spell lifesteal.
However, it is still affected by damage block sources and  Bulwark, but not  Resonant Pulse.
TALENT Acquiring the Shuriken Toss charges  talent instantly grants 1 extra charge.
SPELL STEAL   Jinada applied is based on  Bounty Hunter's current ability level when acquired. Jinada   Link▶️WJ

Illusion Notes:The ability is always toggled on, but illusions cannot trigger it.Modifiers [?]modifier_bounty_hunter_jinadaUndispellable
Ability Draft Notes:
Uses the caster's current attack range when Autocast.Manually casting it uses the cast range.
Gondar's vast experience ensures he never walks away from a transaction empty-handed.


Upon leveling Jinada the first time, it has Autocast on by default.
Despite being an active ability, Jinada can trigger while silenced, if set to Autocast.
Jinada's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. However, it is not affected by cast range bonuses.
Both Autocast and manually casting it uses Bounty Hunter's current attack range.
When off cooldown, Bounty Hunter's weapons emit particle effects.
Checks its cooldown on attack begin, not on attack hit.
This means Jinada does not apply when its cooldown finishes during the attack animation.
Grants regular flat bonus attack damage whenever the ability goes off cooldown, and the bonus is removed when going on cooldown.
When attacking any other units, including buildings and wards, only the attack damage bonus is applied, triggering the cooldown.
Reduces the target's unreliable gold while granting the same amount of Bounty Hunter unreliable gold.
Steals gold only when attacking enemy heroes and clones.
Does not affect illusions and creep-heroes.
Jinada does not work against allies. Shadow Walk Link▶️EW

Requires drafting  Shadow Walk to be unlocked.

TALENT The affected target's vision is shared with Bounty Hunter and his team.

Allies only get the bonus gold if they are within 1200 range of the tracked hero while alive. Bounty Hunter himself gets the gold regardless of distance, even while dead.

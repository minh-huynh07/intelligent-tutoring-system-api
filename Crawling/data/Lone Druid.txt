Sylla's lifelong companion is symbiotic with his spirit and heart, coming to aid him in any time of need.

     Lone Druid's icons at the side of the screen. The currently selected unit is highlighted.  
For all of the  Spirit Bear's stats, please refer to the Spirit Bear's abilities section below.
The Spirit Bear levels up together with Lone Druid, gaining 5 attack damage and 90 health with each level.
The bonuses are applied immediately and do not require the Spirit Bear to be re-summoned.
Grants flat base attack damage. Therefore, it is affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions.
Grants max health, while the current health remains the same flat amount.
For how much bonus health and base attack damage Spirit Bear gains each level, please refer to the chart below.
LEVEL 30 Grants a total of 145 base attack damage and 2610 max health bonus.
TALENT All Spirit Bear related  talents immediately update the current active summon.
On the first cast of Summon Spirit Bear, the bear is summoned. On every following cast, its total health and mana are just replenished or revived.
Since the re-summon is not considered death, buffs and debuffs are neither dispelled, nor projectiles are disjointed.
However, leveling this ability is considered killing the current Spirit Bear and reviving it, this affects the following things:
Interrups the Spirit Bear's current channeling abilities.
Automatically levels up all of the Spirit Bear's abilities.
Resets the current cooldown of  Entangling Claws.
Dispels both buffs and debuffs on the Spirit Bear while disjointing projectiles.
The backlash damage is dealt as pure damage to Lone Druid sourced from the unit that killed the Spirit Bear.
Denying the Spirit Bear causes no backlash damage unless it is killed by neutral creeps.
The Spirit Bear cannot be re-summoned if it receives any player-based damage, regardless of factions, and  Roshan-based damage (before reductions) in the last 3 seconds.
Has no minimum damage threshold, so blocked damage also prevents re-summoning it.
Self-damage sources and damage flagged as HP Removal do not trigger the damage cooldown.
If the Spirit Bear dies, it can be re-summoned immediately.
The cooldown is unaffected by cooldown reduction. However, it is affected by cooldown resetting.
The Spirit Bear is a  Universal Creep-Hero Unit, making it interact differently with certain abilities and mechanics.
The Spirit Bear has an attribute base and gain of 0 + 0  /  /  per Lone Druid level.
Other abilities that affect the Spirit Bear and not other creep-hero units are stated in their respective ability notes.
The following mechanics fully affect the Spirit Bear, but not other creep-hero units:
Illusion creating sources.
The Spirit Bear fully trigger Spell Reflection sources.
Attribute increasing sources fully grants its bonuses to the Spirit Bear.
The Spirit Bear can use every item, except for placing  Observer and Sentry Wards.
Can activate all runes, except  Wisdom Rune.
 Transmute grants Lone Druid the gold and experience when the Spirit Bear uses it.
For more information about Spirit Bear and its item interactions, please refer to the chart below.
Despite the value shown in the HUD, spell damage amplification bonuses fully work for the Spirit Bear. The HUD will always show 0%.
When the Spirit Bear is 1100 range away from Lone Druid, it gets disarmed, turns slightly grey, and uses different animations.
Both the grey hue and disarm symbol are visible to allies only. Other animations are visible to everyone.
The attack restriction is removed upon acquiring  Aghanim's Scepter on the  Spirit Bear.
Has a cast backswing of 0.57 while in  True Form.
SPELL STEAL The summoned  Spirit Bear has its own inventory that can equip  Rubick's items. The bear is instantly killed upon losing the ability, and all items are dropped on its death location. Spirit Link Link▶️WR

Damage done by the ally heals Lone Druid, as well as the other way around.The Spirit Bear is feared for the duration of the transformation, unless it has its own Aghanim's Scepter.

Spirit Link only affects the caster and the caster's Spirit Bear. Does not affect any other player-controlled units.
The buff cannot be dispelled and is granted to both Lone Druid and the Spirit Bear even on death.
Uses lifesteal, but instead of healing Spirit Bear, it heals the Spirit Bear's owner instead.
The lifesteal is affected by lifesteal amplification, but only if the amplification source is on Lone Druid.
Armor shared between Lone Druid and the Spirit Bear or the affected ally is granted as bonus armor.
These shared armor values are truncated despite the HUD supporting armor values up to two decimal points.
Periodically checks Lone Druid's and the Spirit Bear's or the affected ally main and bonus armor, excluding Spirit Link's armor bonus, and adapts the bonuses immediately.
The armor shared is not capped at 0 armor, meaning the shared armor value can be a negative value.
TALENT The Spirit Bear armor  talent effectively grants Lone Druid 2 bonus armor as well.
With LEVEL 3  True Form, Spirit Link effectively grants the Spirit Bear or the affected ally 0/1/1/2 bonus armor.
The visual effect upon leveling up only appears when the Spirit Bear is within 1500 range of Lone Druid.
SCEPTER Adds an active component to Spirit Link, granting all ability bonuses to the targeted ally hero instead of the  Spirit Bear.
Cannot be cast on the Spirit Bear.
Treat creep-heroes, illusions, clones as heroes.
Attacks from Lone Druid now heals the target using lifesteal.
The lifesteal is also affected by lifesteal amplification, but only if the amplification source is on the affected target.
Successive casts on different targets refresh the buff duration and link Lone Druid to the new target.
The previous target is still linked to Lone Druid, but Lone Druid is no longer connected to the previous target.
Therefore, attacks from the previous target still heal Lone Druid, but not the other way around.
Lone Druid and the Spirit Bear are automatically linked back when either all the linked target(s) or Lone Druid is dead.
Upon Lone Druid's death, only the buff on the first targeted ally will be dispelled.
Spirit Bear All ability effects are granted by a status buff instead for the Spirit Bear.
SCEPTER The fountain fear is determined if the  Spirit Bear has  Aghanim's Scepter equipped when Lone Druid casts Spirit Link on an ally hero.
If the Spirit Bear does not have Aghanim's Scepter equipped, Spirit Link mutes and fears the Spirit Bear back to its fountain.
Equipping Aghanim's Scepter after getting feared does not dispel the fear.
Neither fears nor mutes the Spirit Bear if Spirit Link is cast before  Resummoning the Spirit Bear. Savage Roar Link▶️EE

When the cast range exceeds 200, the target will be teleported 200 distance next to the Spirit Bear, Fetch applies the root debuff and the target is dragged.
The Spirit Bear is silenced, disarmed and prevented from acting. It will either last  seconds, or until the rope is broken, whichever is shorter.
Upon cast, the Spirit Bear is ordered to follow  Lone Druid even after the ability ends.
The Spirit Bear can use items while fetching a target.
When the Spirit Bear is affected by other fear sources while active, it moves according to the fear direction.
The Spirit Bear no longer follows Lone Druid if any actions or orders are used to interrupt dragging the affected target to Lone Druid while the ability is active.
When Lone Druid is dead while the ability is active, the Spirit Bear no longer moves and has to be resummoned to move.
Drags the affected target 200 distance behind the Spirit Bear. The affected target is phased and can be dragged over impassable terrain.
Fetch overrides most position changing effects. Therefore, Fetch has a higher priority on most Forced Movement sources. The following conditions can interrupt Fetch:
When either Spirit Bear or target dies.
When Spirit Bear teleports a distance greater than 425 range.
When the target gets teleported (e.g.  Relocate) at any distance.
When being affected by same priority abilities:  Flaming Lasso,  Dismember. Casting these abilities after Fetch will replace Fetch, and vice versa.
When being affected by higher priority abilities:  Hitch A Ride,  Pulverize,  Walrus Kick and  Arena Of Blood.

The Spirit Bear is a Universal creep-hero unit. The bear cannot gain experience, but its health and damage increase with Lone Druid's level by 90 and 5 respectively.

Health Bonus per Hero Level: 90Attack Damage Bonus per Hero Level: 5
Notes
The Spirit Bear has no base attributes and does not gain them when leveling up.
Every point of  /  /  attribute on the Spirit Bear grants their usual bonuses and increases its main attack damage by 0.7.
The Spirit Bear immediately gains a flat 90 health and and 5 base attack damage every time  Lone Druid levels up.
Grants flat base attack damage. Therefore, it is affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions.
Grants max health, while the current health remains the same flat amount.
LEVEL 30 Grants a total of 145 base attack damage and 2610 max health bonus.
The Spirit Bear's current health value from max health increasing sources is based on the ratio of its current health and 1100/1400/1700/2000 ( 2100/2400/2700/3000).
It does not keep the current health percentage when affected by max health sources. The max health granted from  Lone Druid leveling up is considered as max health bonus, and it is not factored into the current health calculations.
This can be defined as expr (BearBaseMaxHP ± MaxHealthSources) × (BearCurrentHP / BearBaseMaxHP)
The health calculation affects the following things:
The Spirit Bear now has 1000/4000 health, and Lone Druid just purchased a  Vitality Booster for the Spirit Bear.
With LEVEL 4  Summon Spirit Bear, the Spirit Bear has a base max health of 2000.
In this example, the ratio between the current health and base max health is 50%.
Therefore, the Spirit Bear will have 1125 health with the item equipped with the current health values.
The Spirit Bear has an inventory and backpack.
Can use every item, except for placing  Observer and Sentry Wards.
Can activate any rune, except  Wisdom Rune.
Despite the value shown in the HUD, spell damage amplification bonuses fully work for the Spirit Bear. The HUD will always show 0%.

The lightning particles and sound effects during the cast time are visible and audible to everyone.

Fully applies the stun while providing vision and True Sight around the target.
Lightning Bolt notes fully apply. If it is not learned, nothing happens.

Also strikes immediately when the last strike was longer than an interval ago and an enemy enters the area.
Always strikes the closest valid target. There are no priorities. Cannot target wards or buildings.

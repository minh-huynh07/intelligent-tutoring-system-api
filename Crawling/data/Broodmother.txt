Spins a large web that grants Broodmother a passive movement speed increase, and boosts regeneration while in its vicinity, as well as giving free movement. Spin Web charges restore every 27 seconds. Spin Web can be cast from anywhere as long as the new web touches an existing web. Webs never expire, and can be manually destroyed. When the maximum limit of webs is exceeded, the oldest web disappears. The movement bonus is proportional to the unit's HP

Notes

InvulnerablePhased



Has a Global cast range when there is another Spin Web within 1200 range of the targeted point.
Upon learning, Broodmother instantly gains 4 charges.
However, leveling it up further does not instantly grant the extra charges.
The buff only affects the caster, and all  Spiderlings and  Spiderites under the player's control. Other player-controlled units are unaffected.
The movement speed bonus gets lower by 0.1%/0.22%/0.34%/0.46% for every 1% of max health missing, reaching 5%/11%/17%/23% bonus when at 1% max health.
The max health percentage is checked periodically and the effects are adapted instantly.
Also increases Broodmother and her Spiders' turn rate to 0.8 and 0.7 respectively.
Does not affect invulnerable or hidden units.
Can regenerate up to 120/300/480/660 health in one minute.
The effects are provided by an aura and its buff lingers for 0.15 seconds.
Leveling up the ability instantly updates the values of all current active Spin Webs.
 Spin Webs are visible on the minimap for Broodmother and her allies.
Does not not provide vision, but are selectable through the Fog of War by Broodmother only.
Does not block neutral creep camps.
Spin Webs can be destroyed with the  Destroy Spin Web sub-ability.

modifier_broodmother_silken_bolaAnyParalytic toxins come from Black Arachnia's fangs, causing a slow and painful death to those who intrude on her webs.


The projectile travels at a speed of 1200.
Silken Bola first applies the debuff, then the damage.
The bonus damage is considered as a conditional attack damage bonus and is magical damage.
Although the attack damage bonus values are not displayed in the HUD, it is still considered and directly added to the unit's attack damage.
However, it is considered by lifesteal, crit or cleave, and it can be reduced only by flat reductions (e.g. magical damage barrier).
Since it is considered bonus attack damage, it is not affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions.
The bonus damage only triggers for allied hero attacks (including illusions and clones, excluding creep-heroes), and any attacks done by units owned by Broodmother.
Blind uses pseudo-random distribution.
Stacks additively with other blind sources and multiplicatively with evasion sources.
Successive casts do not update the ability values but refresh the duration.
TALENT The area of effect  talent turns Silken Bola into a 400 radius area-targeted ability, so that it cannot directly target units anymore. Spinner's Snare Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️DD

Broodmother may create up to 5 invisible web lines touching any existing web. Enemy Heroes that cross the web line will spring the trap, becoming rooted, revealed in fog, and take damage over time. Multiple Heroes can trip on the same line until it's destroyed after being initially triggered. Broodmother's team is alerted via the minimap when an enemy has triggered the snare.

modifier_broodmother_sticky_snare_rootUnknownAbility Draft Notes:
Requires drafting  Spawn Spiderlings to be unlocked.
The slightest tremor of her web is all Arachnia needs to find her prey.


Requires  Aghanim's Scepter to be unlocked.
Has a Global cast range when there is a  Spin Web within 800 range of the targeted point.
The vector-targeted direction of Spinner's Snare is not considered, only the initially selected center point matters.
Cannot be cast within the vicinity of another web line. The vector must not overlap with another line to cast.
The web line forms over a 2-second duration, during which the line is completely inactive.
The web lines are completely invisible to the enemy and cannot be revealed.
Once formed, the line can trigger on enemy heroes and clones coming within its area of effect.
Treats illusions and creep-heroes as creeps.
When triggered, allies get a ‼ Ping on their minimap, while the triggering hero receives a single debuff that applies all ability effects.
The modifier exposes the target, provides True Sight over them, and slows their movement speed.
After 0.25 seconds, the modifier roots the target, preventing them from moving and casting certain mobility abilities.
This means the root effectively lasts 2.75 seconds.
The damage over time starts immediately in the same interval after this delay as well, and ticks in 1-second intervals, resulting up to 4 instances.
Can deal up to 400 damage to the target (before reductions).
Invulnerable and spell immune units can trigger the snare but are not damaged.
Once triggered, the snare becomes visible to enemies and disappears after 3 seconds.
This timer is independent of the debuff on the enemy, so removing the debuff does not cause the snare to disappear earlier.
During this time, other enemy heroes still may get debuffed by the snare.
The snares have no set duration, they last until triggered.
Exceeding the max allowed number of snares instantly destroys the oldest snare.
The snares do not provide vision and are not visible through the Fog of War to anyone. Spawn Spiderlings   Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️RT

 Poison Sting Spawn Spiderite



The projectile travels at a speed of 1200.
Spawn Spiderling first applies the debuff, then the damage.
 Spiderlings only spawn when the targeted unit dies while having the debuff on.
It does not matter who kills the target, if it dies in any way, the Spiderlings spawn.
The number of spiders spawned is based on the level of the ability as the spawn happens, and not on what level it was upon cast.
Multiple instances of Spawn Spiderlings on the same target fully stack, with each cast placing a separate debuff.
The ability has a debuff stack limit of 7. If an enemy has already 7 instances of the debuff, a new cast does not affect them at all.
Spiderlings and  Spiderites are fully affected by  Spin Web.
TALENT The damage increasing  talent immediately upgrades all of Broodmother's currently flying Spawn Spiderling projectiles.

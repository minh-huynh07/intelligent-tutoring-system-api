Deals 12.5/15/17.5/20 bonus damage + 0.8%/1.2%/1.6%/2% ( 1.3%/1.7%/2.1%/2.5%) of the target's max mana as damage (before reductions).
Illusions deal a reduced amount of bonus damage, since the bonus damage is based on the mana burned.
Illusions deal 6.25/7.5/8.75/10 bonus damage + 0.4%/0.6%/0.8%/1% ( 0.65%/0.85%/1.05%/1.25%) of the target's max mana as damage.
Burned mana as damage is considered as a conditional attack damage bonus.
Although the attack damage bonus values are not displayed in the HUD, it is still considered and directly added to Anti-Mage's attack damage.
The attack damage bonus values are not considered by the following sources:
Critical strike sources.
Mana loss manipulation sources, despite burning less mana and the affected target losing less mana.
However, it is considered by lifesteal and cleave, and it can be reduced only by flat reductions (e.g. damage block).
Since it is considered bonus attack damage, it is not affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions.
Mana Break applies the mana burn, the attack damage, and then if the target has no mana left, the movement speed slow debuff.
Does not work against allied units when attacking them.
Does not apply the movement speed slow to units without mana.
Successive movement speed slow debuffs do not stack but refresh its duration.
Plays a different sound effect when the attacked target is below 50% max mana.
Fully stacks with other Mana Break sources. Blink Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️WB

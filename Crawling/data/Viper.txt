Modifiers [?]modifier_viper_poison_attackUndispellable

modifier_viper_poison_attack_slowAnyAbility Draft Notes:
Uses the caster's current attack range when Autocast.Manually casting it uses the cast range.
The Netherdrake's inborn toxic breath quickly drains the vitality of its afflicted.


Poison Attack's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. It is not affected by cast range bonuses.
Since Poison Attack grants attack range bonus while active, both Autocast and manually casting it uses Viper's current attack range.
Poison Attack places one debuff on the target, successive attacks increase its stack count, and resets the duration of the entire stack.
Does not work against allied units or wards.
The number of stacks can be seen on the status buff icon as well.
With 5 ( 7) stacks, it reduces the enemy target's movement speed by 15%/30%/45%/60% ( 21%/42%/63%/84%).
TALENT The movement speed slow increasing  talent further increases the movement speed reduction to 18%/36%/54%/72% ( 25.2%/50.4%/75.6%/100.8%).
For how much magic resistance reduction, damage per second and total damage (before reductions) Poison Attack deals with a certain amount of stacks on each level, please refer to the chart below.
The  magic resistance reduction of Poison Attack stacks additively by itself. However, it stacks multiplicatively with other magic resistance sources.
With max stacks, it reduces most heroes' magic resistance to 10%/2.5%/-5%/-12.5% ( 4%/-6.5%/-17%/-27.5%).
TALENT The magic resistance reduction increasing  talent further reduces the value to -5%/-12.5%/-20%/-27.5% ( -17%/-27.5%/-38%/-48.5%).
Deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after the debuff is applied, resulting in 4 damage instances.
With max stacks, Poison Attack can deal up to 20/40/60/80 ( 28/56/84/112) damage per second, and a total of 80/160/240/320 ( 112/224/336/448) against enemy units in 4 seconds.
TALENT With the damage per second increasing  talent, it can deal up to 24/48/72/96 ( 33.6/67.2/100.8/134.4) damage per second, and a total of 96/192/288/384 ( 134.4/268.8/403.2/537.6) against enemy units.
The attacks first apply the debuff, then their own damage.
SHARD Poison Attack now reduces armor and also applies its effects on buildings as well.
Reduces armor by 1/2/3/4/5/6/7 per stack.
With max stacks, Poison Attack reduces all affected buildings' total magic resistance to -28%/-42%/-56%/-70% ( -56%/-70%/-84%/-98%)
This means it can deal up to 14.34/31.81/52.42/76.16 ( 17.47/38.08/61.82/88.7) damage per second to buildings. Nethertoxin Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️WR

Nethertoxin's projectile travels at a speed of 2000.
All effects of Nethertoxin, including the damage per interval, are provided by an aura. Its debuff lingers for 0.5 seconds.
Deals damage in 0.5-second intervals, starting 0.5 seconds after receiving the debuff, resulting in up to 14/15/16/17 instances.
The damage increases by 1.25/2.81/4.38/5.94 for each 0.5 seconds spent within the area.
Since both the  minimum and maximum value of the damage per interval are increased evenly by 40, the damage increase per interval above remains the same.
As the damage increases per interval, and once it reaches the maximum 17.5/32.5/47.5/62.5 ( 37.5/52.5/67.5/82.5) damage per interval, the damage at subsequent intervals deal the maximum damage, until the end of its duration.
Can deal up to 200/386.25/602.5/848.75 ( 480/686.25/922.5/1188.75) damage within the area for the entire duration (before reductions).
For how much damage per interval Nethertoxin deals, with the damage increasing  talent, please refer to the chart below.
The damage value resets whenever the enemy leaves the radius and enters it again. It does not count accumulated time spent within the radius.
Leveling up the ability or the damage increasing  talent does not update the damage of already placed debuffs.
However, if the debuff is applied after leveling the ability or the talent, the affected enemy takes the new damage values.
Multiple instances of Nethertoxin's debuff do not stack. Corrosive Skin   Link▶️EE

Viper exudes an infectious toxin that damages and slows the attack speed of any enemy that damages it in a 1200 radius. The acid exudate also increases Viper's resistance to magic.

Stacks multiplicatively with other  magic resistance sources.
Increases Viper's magic resistance to 32.5%/36.25%/40%/43.75% ( 43.75%/47.5%/51.25%/55%).
With the magic resistance bonus from this source, every 10 points of  intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 0.9%/0.85%/0.8%/0.75% ( 0.9%/0.85%/0.8%/0.75%). [?]
Applies the damage per second and attack speed slow debuff to whoever damages Viper within 1200 range.
Corrosive Skin procs on all 3 damage types, but not self-inflicted damage and HP Removal effects (e.g.  Sunder,  Soul Ring etc.).
Damage procced is dealt to the damage source itself. This means that the damage dealt by abilities that are not sourced from the caster (e.g.  Proximity Mines), do not trigger Corrosive Skin debuff on the caster.
The damage dealt has the no-reflection flag, preventing its damage from interacting with other sources of damage with the same flag.
Also does not procs on-damage effects.
Deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after the debuff is applied, resulting in 4 damage instances.
Can deal a total of 32/64/96/128 ( 104/136/168/200) damage (before reductions).
Successive procs of Corrosive Skin on the same target do not stack, only the debuff gets refreshed.
Does not affect buildings, wards, hidden or allied units.
Places the debuff on invulnerable units.
Slows the attack speed of invulnerable units, however, it does not damage them.
SCEPTER Corrosive Skin now reduces a total of 16/32/48/64 attack speed within 500 radius upon proc.
Corrosive Skin now first applies the damage per second, then the debuff.
It still deals damage in the same intervals, resulting in a total of 5 damage instances.
Within the near radius, it can deal a total of 80/160/240/320 ( 260/340/420/500) damage.
Within 501 ‒ 1200 radius, it deals up to a total of 40/80/120/160 ( 130/170/210/250) damage instead. Nosedive  Link▶️DL

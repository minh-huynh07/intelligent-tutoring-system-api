↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
Treats illusions, clones, and creep-heroes as heroes.
Although fully affecting creep-heroes, Repel does not grant them the  strength bonus, except for the  Spirit Bear.
Cannot be cast on  Couriers.
Since Repel grants Debuff Immunity, only dispel sources that pierce debuff immunity (e.g.  Doom) can dispel Repel.
Grants  strength and health regeneration bonus based on the amount of current ent_text debuffs (i.e. detrimental ability effects) on the affected target conditionally. This includes the following:
All visible debuffs on the HUD. Although the HUD can only display 12 debuffs at most, each successive debuff applied on the affected target updates the ability values immediately. There is no limit to the granted bonuses.
Debuffs that have incremental stacks are considered as one debuff (e.g.  Quill Spray).
Hidden modifiers do not affect the granted bonuses.
Successive casts do not stack but refresh its duration and ability values.
Both leveling up and the strength and health regeneration bonus per debuff increasing  talent immediately updates all currently active Repel buffs.

Although seeming like a  melee ability, the cast range can be further increased by other cast range bonuses. However, it is not affected by attack range bonuses.
The projectile travels at a speed of 1200.
Hammer of Purity first applies the debuff, then the damage, then heals Omniknight.
Does not perform instant attacks.
The projectile deals one spell damage instance, it is affected by spell damage amplification and works with spell lifesteal.
Neither triggers any attack modifier nor triggers on-hit effects and fully ignores evasion.
Hammer of Purity checks Omniknight's main attack damage periodically and the projectile adapts the damage dealt instantly. Other attack damage bonuses are ignored.
The average damage dealt can be defined as expr (50/75/100/125 + 36 + ΣStr +  50) × 60%/80%/100%/120% ( 135%/155%/175%/195%)
TALENT Although the damage dealt is checked and based on Omniknight's current main attack damage, the main attack damage increasing  talent does not immediately update the current projectile.
SHARD Now automatically casts Hammer of Purity based on its current on Omniknight's attack target. This passive cast has a 6-second charge replenish time.
The passive cast neither triggers the cooldown nor cost mana, and work while the ability is on cooldown. Therefore, they do not proc on-cast effects.
Does not interrupt Omniknight's orders in any way.
A status buff icon on the HUD is displayed whenever the passive cast on the next attack is ready.
Omniknight receives the buff modifier as soon as Hammer of Purity is learned, but it does nothing until the  Ability Upgrade is acquired. Therefore, acquiring the item instantly grants the next attack the passive Hammer of Purity cast. Guardian Angel Link▶️Link▶️RG

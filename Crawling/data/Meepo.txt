Drawing mystical energies from the earth, a Meepo can teleport to another Meepo or itself after channeling for 1.5 seconds, dealing damage in both the departure and arrival locations.If the ability is in alt-cast state, all Meepos will also cast Poof to the target.

Can also be cast on allies within 2000 range. Attempting to target from a further distance targets the ground instead.When ground-targeted, it still only searches for illusions and clones of the caster.
Sometimes breaking one of the Riftshadow Crystals can be just the trick for getting yourself out of a bind. Or your other self.

Alt-Cast Icon
Poof can only be cast on self, clones and illusions of the caster.
Upon leveling Poof for the first time, it has Alt-cast disabled by default, activating Alt-Cast on one Meepo changes the ability's functionality on all Meepos.
Newly created Meepos from leveling up  Divided We Stand or the +1 clone talent will always have Alt-Cast off initially. Toggling Alt-Cast on any Meepo will cause the new clone's Poof to start copying the Alt-Cast status normally.
With Alt-Cast disabled:
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
To Poof to invulnerable or hidden targets, it has to be unit-targeted to Poof to the target.
When ground-targeted, the Meepo closest to the target point is chosen upon the completion of the ability's cast point, which can be the same Meepo who casts Poof.
With Alt-Cast activated:
Neither can Poof to invulnerable nor hidden targets.
Unit-targeting a specific Meepo will cause all Meepos to cast Poof on the targeted Meepo, if able.
When ground-targeted, all Meepos except the casting Meepo will Poof to the Meepo nearest to the targeted location, if able. This interrupts the casting Meepo's actions even though it does not Poof.
Does not disjoint projectiles.
Poof deals its damage once at the cast location and once at the destination point.
The damage from Poof stacks, so enemies within the cast location and destination point effectively take double the damage.
Can deal up to the following amount of damage (before reductions) when a certain number of Meepos casts it at the same spot:
1x : 120/180/240/300 ( 220/280/340/400)
2x : 240/360/480/600 ( 440/560/680/800)
3x : 360/540/720/900 ( 660/840/1020/1200)
4x : 480/720/960/1200 ( 880/1120/1360/1600)
5x : 600/900/1200/1500 ( 1100/1400/1700/2000)

Ransack first deals the spell damage, heals the attacking Meepo, then deals its attack damage.
Treat  Couriers and illusions as heroes, and creep-heroes as creeps.
The bonus damage is applied as pure spell damage in a separate damage instance, it is affected by spell damage amplification and works with spell lifesteal.
Heals all Meepos, including the attacking Meepo, excluding illusions, by a set amount.
Always heals for the full amount per attack, regardless of how much damage the target actually takes.
The heal counts as lifesteal, so that it is affected by lifesteal manipulation, but not by heal manipulation.
Can heal a single Meepo up to 9/24/45/72 health on each attack per  Divided We Stand level.
Does not work against  Roshan and on allies. Dig Link▶️Link▶️DT

Requires  Aghanim's Scepter to be unlocked.
MegaMeepo and the  MegaMeepo Fling sub-ability is only granted to the Meepo Prima and not to any of the  Meepo Clones.
Casting the ability when there are no Meepo Clones within  radius of the Meepo Prime does nothing and puts the ability into cooldown.
All Meepo Clones within the radius travel to the Meepo Prime at a speed of 900 upon cast.
Hidden and invulnerable Meepo Clones do not travel to the Meepo Prime.
Does not disjoint already traveling Meepo Clones upon cast.
Grants the Meepo Clones invulnerability and turns them hidden while traveling to the Meepo Prime.
Periodically moves all Meepo Clones stacked to the Meepo Prime's current position. This affects the following things:
Upon MegaMeepo ending in any way, the Meepo Clones reappear at Meepo Prime's current location.
Every aura the Meepo Clones have is now bestowed around the Meepo Prime.
 Relocate and  Recall cause the affected Meepo Clone to be selectively removed from the MegaMeepo stack and reappear.
This neither changes the MegaMeepo stacked height nor the Meepo Clone's stacked position.
The Meepo Prime still wields its weapon and its always placed at the bottom of the MegaMeepo stack.
Other Meepo Clones, except the highest Meepo Clone, visually raises their hands up visually carrying the other Meepo Clones above them on the stack.
Grants the Meepo Prime  all attributes bonus based on the current highest attribute value from base attributes and attributes gained from levels, and from the number of Meepo Clones stacked. This can be defined as:
expr ⌊( ⌊HighestAttribute⌋ × 0.4 )⌋ × 1/2/3 ( 2/3/4)
This affects the following things:
Does not include attributes from the  Attribute Bonus, the strength increasing  talent and item sources.
For example,  Meepo at Level 18 has  61.4 /  52.7 /  50.3 and LEVEL 3  Divided We Stand.
Upon casting MegaMeepo, 3 Meepo Clones are now stacked on the Meepo Prime.
Since  strength is the highest attribute, hence, MegaMeepo grants the Meepo Prime 72  all attributes bonus.
The Meepo Prime keeps the current health and mana percentages upon losing MegaMeepo form.

Upon leveling, the Meepo Clones always spawn with full health and mana next to Meepo Prime, even when leveling from a clone.
The Meepo Prime and his clones are each represented by an icon with health and mana bars for each on the top left corner of the screen.

However, they do not benefit from other stats from item bonuses (damage, health, armor, etc.).
The bonuses of  Attribute Bonus and strength talent,  Switch Attribute and  Switch Attribute are also not copied.
When Meepo Prime loses attributes (e.g. to  Decay or  Glaives of Wisdom), the Meepo Clones' attributes adapt.
However, Meepo Clones themselves are still independently subjected to attribute loss. The other Meepo Clones do not adapt to any of the other clones losing attributes.
Stacks multiplicatively with other  magic resistance sources.
Increases both the Meepo Prime and Meepo Clones' magic resistance to 32.5%/36.25%/40%.

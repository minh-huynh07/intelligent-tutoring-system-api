Spectre flings a dagger to draw a Shadow Path, dealing damage and slowing the movement speed of any enemies along the trail. Units hit by the dagger also trail a Shadow Path. While treading the path, Spectre phases through otherwise impassable terrain. Spectral Dagger applies an instance of Desolate to targets with no allied units within 400 radius of them.

modifier_spectre_spectral_daggerAnyAbility Draft Notes:
 Desolate must be drafted as well for it to get applied.
Mercurial's dagger eclipses the physical plane in shadow, a state in which mortals cower, but spectres thrive.


The Spectral Dagger travels at a speed of 800.
Treat clones, illusions and the  Spirit Bear as heroes, other creep-heroes as creeps.
When unit-targeted, the Spectral Dagger homes in on the target unit until it reaches it.
Only heroes can be unit-targeted.
Targeting other units other than heroes causes the Spectral Dagger to be ground-targeted.
When ground-targeted, the Spectral Dagger travels 1800 range in a straight line and does not home in on any target.
Spectral Dagger damages every enemy unit that comes within 125 range of the travelling dagger and applies movement speed slow with the path modifier.
The dagger also applies one instance of  Desolate based on its current level if the target is a lone target within 400 radius.
Only units damaged by Spectral Dagger are considered valid targets for this Desolate application.
Desolate notes fully apply. If it is not learned, or if the caster does not have Desolate, no bonus damage is applied.
Spectral Dagger first deals its damage, applies Desolate, then applies the Spectral Dagger debuff.
Applies the Dagger Path Creator debuff on hit enemy heroes, making them trail a Shadow Path like the Spectral Dagger.
This debuff also grants shared vision over the enemy heroes, revealing their silhouette when they become invisible.
Grants Spectre the following bonuses while on the Shadow Path:
Movement speed bonus from the path modifier, and its buff lingers for 4 seconds after leaving the path.
Successive movement speed buff refreshes its duration from the same source.
An enemy Spectral Dagger does not apply the movement speed slow on Spectre when she has the buff modifier.
Although the path modifier is applied on illusions, it does not increase their movement speed.
Unobstructed movement from a hidden buff, and its buff lingers for 1 second after leaving the path.
The hidden buff is not applied to Spectre's illusions.
The Shadow Path's segments last 12 seconds from the moment they were created, not as the ability was cast.
The Shadow Path grants 200 radius flying vision around itself.
Both the path modifier on Spectre and on enemies while being on the path is dispellable.
However, as long as Spectre stays on the path, it is immediately reapplied to her again.
For enemies, the movement speed slow debuff is not reapplied immediately but is applied again if they leave the path and enter it again.
Dispelling the path creating debuff on enemy heroes stops them from creating or extending the path, but does not remove already created paths.
The number of debuff reapplication attempts is affected by the following conditions:
When Spectre, the primary target and the secondary target are in a straight line, the debuff will be reapplied 11 and 10 times on the secondary target with a 24-bound radius and an 8-bound radius respectively.
The debuff will reapplied 8 times, when the secondary target touches, but does not intersect with the Spectral Dagger path.
Spectral Dagger of different sources are independent of each other.
Does not affect  Couriers.

Often times, warriors find themselves alone with a vision of Mercurial - the fated question is if it is the true Spectre.


Applies Desolate's effects in the following conditions:
Upon Spectre's attack hitting the target.
Upon a lone target being damaged by  Spectral Dagger or  Reality within 400 radius.
The bonus damage is dealt in a separate damage instance and counts as spell damage.
This means it is not affected or considered by anything that works with attack damage.
This also means that it fully works with spell damage amplification and spell lifesteal.
Works against any enemy unit, except for wards and buildings.
Desolate completely ignores nearby wards, buildings, ally  Couriers, invulnerable and hidden units.
This means that Desolate still deals its damage when the target only has any of the above as allies nearby.
Only checks for allies of the target, meaning nearby neutral creeps do not prevent it from dealing damage to units of the enemy team, and vice versa. Dispersion   EI

A daunting task lies before enemies of Mercurial - killing a shadow with blade and magic.


Dispersion reflects damage before all damage manipulations (including damage from allies), the damage received can only be affected by incoming damage manipulation applied on Spectre by enemies.
This effectively reflects overkill damage dealt to Spectre. If a damage source exceeded Spectre's current health and killed her, the damage reflected will be the same damage value.
If both Spectre and an enemy would die to the damage simultaneously, the enemy is always killed first.
Applies generic incoming damage reduction on Spectre. Stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation.
Neither reduces nor reflects damage flagged as HP removal.
Effectively increases Spectre's survivability against all damage types by 9%/14%/19%/25% ( 15%/20%/27%/33%).
Affects and reflects all damage types Spectre receives, the reflected damage is returned as the same damage type as it was received.
Damage reflected is flagged as HP Removal, it does not trigger any on-damage effects.
Reflected damage is not shared between enemies within the radius, all of them take the full amount of damage based on their distance with Spectre.
Reflects the full 8%/12%/16%/20% ( 13%/17%/21%/25%) within a 300 radius from Spectre. Then the reflected damage decreases linearly up to a 800 radius from Spectre.
This is how much damage Dispersion reflects back to enemies at certain distances:
300 Distance: 8%/12%/16%/20% ( 13%/17%/21%/25%) ×  1.5 of dealt damage.
425 Distance: 6%/9%/12%/15% ( 9.75%/12.75%/15.75%/18.75%) ×  1.5 of dealt damage.
550 Distance: 4%/6%/8%/10% ( 6.5%/8.5%/10.5%/12.5%) ×  1.5 of dealt damage.
675 Distance: 2%/3%/4%/5% ( 3.25%/4.25%/5.25%/6.25%) ×  1.5 of dealt damage.

SHARD Adds an active component to Dispersion that increases damage reflected to 8%/12%/16%/20% ( 13%/17%/21%/25%) while active, with the passive effects still present. Reality  Link▶️DR

 Spectral Dagger and  Desolate must be drafted as well for them to get applied respectively.
The scattered shadows unite into the one true Spectre.


Reality is unlocked upon learning  Haunt and always stays active.
Does not disjoint projectiles upon cast.
When ground-targeted, Spectre exchanges places with the closest  Shadow Step-based illusion from the targeted point.

Instantly applies  Spectral Dagger modifier without using a projectile, based on its current level on the target. This can only happen once per illusion.
Also apply one instance of  Desolate based on its current level if the target is a lone target within 400 radius.
Spectral Dagger applied by Reality does not cost any mana and is applied even if the ability itself is currently not castable.
Spectral Dagger notes fully apply. If it is not leveled, no buffs or debuffs are applied.
SCEPTER Can be cast multiple times until  Haunt ends or all Shadow Step-based illusions are dead.
After swapping positions, the Shadow Step illusion still walks towards its target and attacks it. Haunt Link▶️Link▶️FE

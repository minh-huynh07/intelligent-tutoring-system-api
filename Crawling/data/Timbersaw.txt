DamagePhysical

Timbersaw whirls extremely sharp edges, damaging enemies and destroying trees around him in an area. If an enemy hero is affected, it loses some of its primary attribute for a short duration. Whirling Death will deal bonus damage per tree destroyed.

Interrupts Timbersaw's channeling abilities upon cast.
Whirling Death first applies the debuff, then the damage.
Destroys trees within 325 radius around Timbersaw upon cast.
Checks for the affected enemy heroes' current primary attribute, then reduces their current total primary attributes, including base and bonus attributes.
 Universal heroes loses 5% of  all attributes.
The attribute reduction does not update if the affected target(s) gain or lose primary attributes after the debuff is placed.
Whirling Death cannot reduce any attributes below 0. The actual attribute reduction displayed on the HUD is truncated since it does not display attributes with decimal points. This affects the following things:
 Sven at Level 1 has   22 strength with a max health of 604 and is affected by Whirling Death.
His strength is reduced to   19.14; however, the strength value displayed on the HUD is rounded up to 19 instead. This is not his actual strength value.
Sven's actual strength will be   19 after the primary attribute reduction, and his max health is 541.08, before Whirling Death deals its damage.
Successive Whirling Death attribute reductions will use the current strength values,  19.14 in this example, following the same notes as above.
Whirling Death first reduces current health by 22 per  strength, then the damage.
Upon losing the debuff, enemies first only regain 19 health per strength, before gaining their attributes back.
Does not regain health based on the health bonus per strength values. [?]
Health regain this way is considered as setting health.
Has no effect on affected units' current mana percentage if  intelligence is reduced.
Debuffs of successive casts stack additively, with each cast placing a new debuff with its duration independent of each other.
The attribute reduction fully affects illusions,  Meepo Clones and the  Tempest Double. Timber Chain  Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️WT

Timbersaw fires a chain that embeds itself in the first tree it hits, pulling him towards it. Any enemy in the path takes damage.

You never know when you might need to escape from malevolent saplings.


The chain travels at a speed of 2200/2400/2600/2800 and always travels either the full distance or until connecting with a tree.
With the maximum travel distance and tree search radius, it can connect to trees up to 840/990/1140/1290 ( 1965/2115/2265/2415) range away.
The hooked tree is destroyed once the chain stops pulling.
Fully damages invisible and untargetable units.
Can pull Timbersaw over impassable terrain and through trees.
Timbersaw stops being pulled if he is disabled at any point during Timber Chain.
If Timbersaw is disabled before the chain starts pulling, the chain still pulls him for a very short distance.
This is still enough to cause damage around him to nearby units or to interact with distance-based ability effects (e.g.  Rupture).
Timbersaw is disarmed, but he can cast abilities during the pull.
The chain's tip briefly provides 100 radius ground vision around itself while traveling, and 400 radius ground vision once reaching maximum distance or connecting with a tree. Reactive Armor   Link▶️Link▶️EE

Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
Reactive Armor can now be activated to get max stacks and 200 damage barrier. Grants Timbersaw 100 + 75 barrier amount per second for each enemy hero within 600 radius of Timbersaw up to a maximum of 800. After 8 seconds, Timbersaw deals damage to every hero within 600 radius equal to 200 + his remaining barrier amount and loses all of his barrier.

Break Notes:Prevents gaining new stacks.Existing stacks still provide bonus armor and health regeneration.If Break is applied by an attack, Reactive Armor first triggers on that attack before getting disabled.

The saw-suit is equipped to react to the slightest touch with fortified defenses.


Reactive Armor only triggers when a unit lands an attack, regardless of distance. This means it cannot trigger on missed attacks.
The Reactive Armor stack is always granted right before the attacker's damage is dealt to Timbersaw.
Does not trigger on instant attacks that cannot proc attack modifiers (e.g.  Split Shot before learning the  Split Shot uses modifiers talent and  Flak Cannon).
Can trigger on attacks from wards, buildings and allies.
Each stack has its own duration and is independent of other stacks. The amount of stacks is shown on the status buff icon.
Treats clones, illusions and creep-heroes as heroes.
At max stacks, Reactive Armor grants 6/12/19.8/29.4 ( 8.4/15/23.4/33.6) bonus armor and 4.5/9.6/16.5/25.2 ( 6.3/12/19.5/28.8) bonus health regeneration on each level.
Can regenerate up to 45/115.2/231/403.2 ( 72/172.8/330/554.4) health over its full duration.
For how much armor and health regeneration bonus a certain amount of Reactive Armor stacks on each level grants, including the max stacks increasing  talent, please refer to the chart below.
The amount of stacks is also visually indicated by a dome that closes over on Timbersaw. The exhaust on the suit also starts emitting fire once the dome is fully closed.
The dome has 4 fragments, each appearing for every 4 stacks (1 – 4, 5 – 8, 9 – 12, 13 – 16). The dome opens again upon dropping below the given amount of stacks.
SCEPTER Adds an active component to Reactive Armor, with the passive effects still present.
Interrupts Timbersaw's channeling abilities upon cast.
A timer above Timbersaw's head shows how much time is left before the damage barrier blows up. This timer is visible to everyone.
SCEPTER Grants Timbersaw a  universal damage barrier that absorbs damage values of all damage types (after all reductions), causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity.
Stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources.
Universal damage barrier has the lowest priority in the group of damage barriers, its capacity is depleted last when combined with other damage-type barriers.
However, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g.  Refraction), Reactive Armor does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire.
The  pure damage barrier has a 200 base capacity, and gradually increases up to 800 capacity based on the number of enemy heroes within 600 radius.
The capacity increases and regenerate in ≈0.1-second intervals, up to 17.5/25/32.5/40/47.5 capacity per interval with 5 heroes within the radius.
Enemy heroes leaving or entering the area after cast fully affects the capacity increase and regeneration value.
Treat clones and creep-heroes as heroes, and illusions as creeps.
SCEPTER Dispelling the Reactive Armor buff removes the damage barrier, causes it to burst and deal area damage prematurely.
This includes Timbersaw dying while the buff is active, it instantly blows up, damaging enemy units around Timbersaw based on the current remaining capacity.
The area damage (before reductions) can be defined as expr 200 + CurrentCapacity

Fires your main saw blade at the target location where it will spin in place, dealing damage in an area around it. Enemies caught in the saw blade will move more slowly for every 5% of health missing. The blade deals damage and cuts down trees in its path when fired and retracted. While active the ability costs mana, and you lose the ability to attack.

Chakram travels at a speed of 900.
Disarms Timbersaw as soon as the Chakram is launched, until the Chakram fully returns to Timbersaw.
While traveling towards the target point, the blade deals pass damage, and movement speed slows on enemy units within range once.
Upon reaching the target area, the Chakram deals 25/37.5/50 damage (before reductions), and drains 7/11/15 of Timbersaw's mana in 0.5-second intervals, starting 0.5 seconds after reaching the target area.
The Chakram also applies a movement speed slow aura to enemies which lingers for 0.5 seconds.
The Chakram stops draining mana and dealing damage over time as soon as it starts to return.
While returning, the Chakram deals the pass damage to nearby units again and slows enemy units' movement speed by placing a debuff again.
The movement speed slow from the Chakram passing, in both directions, lasts 0.5 seconds.
The movement speed slow debuff from passing and from the stationary aura is the same. However, the former is dispellable, the latter is not.
A passing Chakram first applies the passing damage, then the debuff.
The passing damage may only damage the same unit once when flying toward the targeted point, and once again when returning.
The Chakram returns to Timbersaw in the following conditions:
Upon using the  Return Chakram sub-ability.
When it exceeds 2000 range away.
The effective area for the link break distance is half of a sphere and not a flat circle. Therefore, the Chakram returns when Timbersaw is moved upward far enough.
The Chakram instantly disappears and does not return upon Timbersaw's death, even with Reincarnation.
The first 5% ( 9%) movement speed slow is applied at 95% – 100% of the affected target's max health.
As the affected target's max health goes lower, the Chakram slows up to 100% movement speed when the affected target's max health is below 5% ( 50%) max health.
The movement speed slow debuff of  Chakram and  Second Chakram stack with each other, but do not stack with multiple of themselves.
Chakram provides 300 radius flying vision while spinning in place at the target area.
Does not provide vision while the Chakram is traveling. Return Chakram Link▶️RC

This ability is not available in Ability Draft.
Nevermore's trademark for harvesting souls.


Leveling any of the three  Shadowraze abilities levels the others as well.
Shadowraze (Near) blasts a 250 radius area 200 range in front of Nevermore upon cast.
This means that it can hit units up to 50 range behind Shadow Fiend, and up to 450 range in front of him.
Places one hidden debuff on the enemy. This debuff counts how many Shadowrazes hit the target within its duration.
Shadowraze first sets its damage based on current stacks, then applies the debuff or increases the stack count, then deals the damage, and then the instant attack.
This means the first stack added by the raze does not affect the ability's damage.
A number on the icon shows how many times the debuff was refreshed, including the first cast.
The debuff has no stack limit and can be increased infinitely.
Hitting all 3 Shadowrazes consecutively can deal up to 370/600/830/1060 damage to a single unit (before reductions) and applies up to 24%/26%/28%/30% movement speed slow.
With the base damage increasing  talent, they can deal up to 715/945/1175/1405 damage.
With the stack damage increasing  talent, they can deal up to 420/650/880/1110 damage.
With both  talents, they can deal up to 765/995/1225/1455 damage.
The hidden debuff is placed on heroes and is used to count successive Shadowraze hits. It lasts for 3 seconds.
Although only the Demon Eater cosmetic item makes use of it, the counter is always placed.
TALENT With the Shadowraze using attack damage  talent, Shadowraze causes Shadow Fiend to perform an instant attack on all hit enemies within its effect radius.
These instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers, including   Necromastery, and on-hit effects normally, with cleave being an exception. They have True Strike and completely ignore disarms.

Instantly grants 1 ( 2) stack(s) from killing any unit, including ward-type units and allies, despite the visual effects.
Does not grant stacks from killing the following units:
From denying allied  Observer Wards and  Sentry Wards.
From illusions and the  Tempest Double.
From Runes.
From buildings.
The number of the current stack is visible on the status buff icon, and it is always rounded down upon death.
This can be defined as expr ⌊ StackNumber × 0.3 ⌋
Shadow Fiend can never lose all gathered souls. Necromastery keeps 1 stack, even when dying while only having 1 stack.
The number of stacks is not lost during Reincarnation.
The more souls Shadow Fiend has, the more red particles fly around his chest area.
Grants a total of 11/28/51/80 ( 44/70/102/140) regular flat bonus attack damage with the maximum amount of souls.
SCEPTER Necromastery grants up to a total of 25/50/75/100 ( 100/125/150/175) regular flat bonus attack damage with the maximum amount of souls.
These extra souls affect the number of lines created by  Requiem of Souls.
When losing the  Ability Upgrade, the attack damage bonus adapts immediately and does not account for the extra souls.
Shadow Fiend keeps his stacks even when having more than the default allowed amount. However, Requiem of Souls still releases more lines in this case.
SHARD Necromastery turns into an active attack modifier, with the passive components still present.
Necromastery's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. It is not affected by cast range bonuses.
Both Autocast and manually casting it uses Shadow Fiend's current attack range.
SHARD Upon cast, the attack projectile is replaced with a thicker particle.
The Necromastery attack fears the target, and has an ensured critical strike, crits with a lower value have no effect if they proc since the higher crit value takes priority.
The attack, including instant attacks (e.g.   Shadowraze), first applies the fear debuff, then its own damage.
Necromastery's fear makes affected enemies run away from the caster, rather than make them run toward their team's fountain.
Consumes a stack and goes on cooldown upon projectile launch, therefore missing the attack wastes the soul and cooldown.
Cannot be cast without stacks, attempting to do so releases a regular attack without triggering the cooldown. Presence of the Dark Lord   FP

DamageMagical

Shadow Fiend gathers his captured souls to release them as lines of demonic energy. Units near Shadow Fiend when the souls are released can be damaged by several lines of energy. Any unit damaged by Requiem of Souls will be feared and have its movement speed and magic resistance reduced for 0.7 seconds for each line hit up to a maximum of 2.15. Lines of energy are created for every soul captured through Necromastery.Requiem of Souls is automatically cast whenever Shadow Fiend dies, regardless of its cooldown.

 Necromastery must be drafted as well for Requiem of Souls to work.
The captured souls of those past slain are released to ravage their former allies.


Grants Shadow Fiend phased movement during the ability's cast point.
The damage is entirely based on the number of souls gathered with  Necromastery.
The damaging lines have the following mechanics:
The area of every single damaging line is shaped like a cone.
The distance between the damaging lines is always even. One line is always released towards the east and the others adapt accordingly.
Creates a line on every 32.7°th/25.7°th/21.2°th/18°th ( 14.4°th) with the maximum number of souls on each level of Necromastery.
The damaging lines travel at a speed of 700, taking 1.43 seconds to reach the max distance.
With the travel distance and end width, the damaging lines can hit units up to 1350 range away.
Each damaging line cannot hit the same unit more than once per cast upon expanding and returning respectively.
Fears and reduces the movement speed of all enemy units hit by the damaging lines of Requiem of Souls.
The duration increases by 0.7 ( 0.95) per each line hit, but is capped at 2.15 ( 3.35) seconds.
Each line, including the returning lines, starts a new fear instance at the time of impact.
Requiem of Souls' fear makes affected enemies run away from the caster, rather than make them run toward their team's fountain.
Affected creeps do not move.
The expanding lines can deal up to 1600/2400/3200 damage to a single unit (before reductions), if all lines hit.
Each line first removes the movement and magic resistance reducing debuff, then applies the damage, then the fear debuff, and then re-apply the removed debuff.
This means the lines' damage does not benefit from the magic resistance reduction at all.
Stacks multiplicatively with other  magic resistance sources.
Reduces most heroes' magic resistance to 21.25%/17.5%/13.75%.
With the magic resistance reduction from this source, every 10 points of  intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 1.05%/1.1%/1.15%. [?]
Upon death, Requiem of Souls is passively and  instantly cast, regardless of mana and cooldown.
If the caster does not have Requiem of Souls, it will not be passively cast.
Shadow Fiend first loses 30% of his Necromastery souls before this happens, so this passive cast can only have a maximum of 7/9/11/14 ( 17) lines.
Requiem of Souls cast passively is not upgraded by Aghanim's Scepter, does not apply fear, but does apply the movement speed slow.
The passive cast does not trigger with Reincarnation.
COSMETIC Has a cast backswing of 1.2 with the  Demon Eater equipped.
SCEPTER After the lines expand to their maximum distance, they return back to Shadow Fiend.
Despite the visual effects, the lines do not "respawn" around Shadow Fiend. They start returning back exactly where they stopped.
The lines return at the same speed to Shadow Fiend's current location, not to the location Requiem of Souls was originally cast from.
The lines do not follow if Shadow Fiend moves. Once the lines start returning, their path cannot be further altered.
The maximum travel distance also applies to the lines also upon returning, meaning they travel a total distance of 2000, taking 2.86 seconds.
The width of the lines is reversed upon returning — starting with the maximum width and getting thinner towards the end.
The returning lines deal 60% damage. They hit all units regularly like the expanding lines and also apply the movement speed slow and fear debuff.
SCEPTER The returning lines can deal up to 1200/1800/2400 damage to a single unit, if all lines hit.
Together with the expanding lines, it can deal up to 3200/4800/6400 damage to a single unit (before reductions).
The heal is based on per hero hit by the returning lines, not by the initial expanding lines, and it is applied as soon as the lines stop moving.
Always heals for 48/72/96 health per hero hit, regardless of how much damage the lines actually dealt.
Only heals from damage dealt to heroes, including illusions.
SPELL STEAL This ability's cast point is not modified when acquired. The lines created are based on  Shadow Fiend's current  Necromastery stacks when acquired.

Forms a barrier of energized cogs around Clockwerk, trapping any units that are near. Allies in the cogs when they are created receive a physical damage barrier. Enemies outside the trap that touch a cog are knocked back, losing health and mana. Damage is increased by 50% of the mana burned. Once a cog has delivered a shock, it will power down.  Cogs can be destroyed by enemy attacks, but Clockwerk can destroy them with just one.

The cogs are always placed in the same formation.
8 cogs are placed so that they form a circle around Clockwerk. The center of the circle is empty.
Each cog is spawned 215 range away from Clockwerk, effectively blocking a 255 radius circle due to their bound radius.
All cogs are placed at a 164.5 range distance from each other. Together with their bound radius, the gap between the cogs is 4.5.
This means that any unit trapped within the center of the circle cannot move out unless it has unobstructed movement or its bound radius is ≤ 4.5.
A cog shocks the first enemy unit which comes within 185 range of it from the outside. A cog can only shock a unit once.
The cogs only shock units that have mana (e.g.  Ranged Creep), units without mana are not shocked (e.g.  Roshan).
Does not shock units who are already under the effect of forced movement sources, except for  Force Staff and  Hurricane Pike.
The shock does not require vision and can hit invisible enemies, or enemies in the Fog of War.
Knocks units back into the direction they approach the cog from.
The knockback distance is 300 at a speed of 375, so it lasts exactly 0.8 second.
Destroys trees enemies come in contact with during the knockback.
Affected enemies are fully disabled during the knockback.
Therefore, the shock first applies the knockback, the damage, and then the mana loss.
Although the cogs deliver the shocks, all effects (knockback, damage, and mana loss) are sourced to the caster, not the cog.
Non-player-controlled units (i.e. lane creeps) do not try to path around the cogs, but simply walk against them as if they are not there.
This effectively causes them to get stuck, until they change directions (e.g. when being aggro'd), or until the cogs expire.
The cogs can also be attacked and destroyed or denied by allies, taking the same amount of attacks as enemies. Only Clockwerk can destroy them in one hit.
Attacks from heroes deal 50 ( 25) damage.
Creeps do not attack Power Cogs. [?]
Power Cogs has an aura at its center with a radius of 225 that debuffs enemy heroes and buff ally heroes.
By default, the debuff does nothing but create particle effects on enemies within.
Treats illusions, clones, and creep-heroes as heroes.
The aura always lasts the full duration and lingers for 0.5 seconds, even if all cogs get destroyed.
The aura grants a  magical damage barrier on the affected targets that absorbs magical damage values, causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity.
Stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources.
Has a higher priority than universal damage barriers in the group of damage barriers.
However, when combined with other damage-negating sources (e.g.  Refraction), Power Cogs does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire.
TALENT With the debuff immunity granting  talent, the same aura now grants Clockwerk debuff immunity with dispel within the radius.
The aura first applies the basic dispel, then grants debuff immunity. The aura effects are also reapplied upon reentry.
Stacks multiplicatively with other magic resistance sources.
Increases Clockwerk's magic resistance to 62.5%.
With the magic resistance bonus from this source, every 10 points of  intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 0.5%. [?]
SCEPTER While  Overclocking, the same aura also grants Clockwerk 250 attack speed bonus within the radius. Rocket Flare Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️ER

The Rocket Flare travels at a speed of 2250.
Rocket Flare first applies the damage, then the movement speed slow.
Successive debuff does not stack but refreshes its duration.
Provides a 1-second 250 radius flying vision while traveling, and 600 radius flying vision that lingers for 6 seconds at the targeted area after reaching it.
TALENT The Rocket Flare True Sight  talent grants True Sight at the targeted area for 10 seconds.
Immediately updates all of Clockwerk's currently flying rockets. However, it does not add True Sight to rockets that already reached their targeted point and exploded.
The True Sight is provided by an aura which affects enemies. Its debuff lingers for 0.5 seconds.
Does not reveal   Enchanted Trees.
The projectile can be seen on the minimap. It appears green to allies and red to enemies.
Enemies require vision over the area to see it.
The projectile blocks neutral creeps camps.
SCEPTER While  Overclocking, Rocket Flare fires a total of 3 rockets, launched in 0.15-second intervals of each other horizontally upon cast.
The rockets are launched in the following sequence: Target Area ➤ 125° to the right area ➤ 125° to the left area.
Overclocking also sets the cooldown to 3 while active.
Does not reset the ability's cooldown if cast before Overclocking is active.
The cooldown reducing  talent is not applied to the Overclocking Rocket Flare cooldown.
SHARD While  Jetpack is active, Rocket Flare can be cast without facing the targeted area. Overclocking Link▶️Link▶️DF

Requires  Aghanim's Shard to be unlocked.
Upon cast, the following ability effects are applied on Clockwerk while the ability is active:
Clockwerk is disarmed and ascends 260 units above the z-axis.
Does not need to turn to cast abilities or items within its cast range, this is not limited to only Clockwerk's abilities.
Clockwerk is not disabled while Jetpack is active.
For better readability, the turn rate during the flight is given as degrees per second, instead of radians per 0.033 seconds.
75° ( 150°) per second equal a turn rate of 0.044 ( 0.087).
Clockwerk turns for a maximum of 1 second per issued move order. This means a single move order does not cause him to fly in a circle around the targeted point.
Clockwerk's final path and direction pre-move order depends on a vector from his position to the targeted point, which is always parallel with the path.
Casting  Hookshot dispels Jetpack if it latches on a target and starts pulling. Does not end it if it misses.
The flight speed equals Clockwerk's current movement speed.
SPELL STEAL  Rubick ascends 150 units above the z-axis instead and does not turn into a flying unit. Hookshot Link▶️Link▶️RT

Modifiers [?]modifier_rattletrap_hookshotDeath

modifier_stunnedStrongA somewhat unwieldy device, the Hookshot sends the otherwise clunky Clockwerk armor flying through the air.


The hook travels at a speed of 4000/5000/6000, taking a maximum of 0.5 seconds to reach max length.
The effective area for the hook travel distance is half of a sphere and not a flat circle. Therefore, the hook may latch onto units on the z-axis as well.
Provides 125 radius ground vision while the hook is traveling, and 300 radius ground vision while the hook latches or reaches its maximum travel distance. Both vision radius does not linger.
As soon as the hook latches on a unit, Clockwerk is pulled towards the unit at the same speed as the hook itself.
Clockwerk gets pulled towards the latched unit's current location, and not towards the original location where the hook latched on it.
This means when the target moves or gets moved, Clockwerk's trajectory adapts immediately.
Clockwerk is silenced and disarmed during the pull. However, item abilities can be used.
The pulling lasts a maximum of 0.5 seconds, so if the target moves too far away, Clockwerk may not fully reach it.
The pull gets canceled when Clockwerk gets affected by other forced movement sources.
The area damage and stun around Clockwerk always happens, regardless of whether the hook latched on an ally or enemy.
When latching on an ally, the ally is not disabled and can act freely. It is not interrupted either.
When latching on an enemy, it gets stunned for 1.2/1.4/1.6 seconds, or until Clockwerk reaches it.
This means if Clockwerk does not reach it, it is stunned for the full duration.
This can happen when either the pull gets canceled, or when the target gets moved too far away during the pull.
The latched enemy is also hit by the stun and area damage.
This means the latched target is stunned up to 1.7/1.9/2.1 ( 2.3/2.6/2.9) seconds longer than secondary targets, due to the initial latch stun.
Hookshot first applies the debuff, then the damage.
Fully ignores  Couriers, wards, buildings and hidden units.
Can latch on invulnerable or invisible units.
SCEPTER While  Overclocking, Hookshot's stun and damage radius is increased to 262.5.
SHARD While  Jetpack is active, Hookshot can be cast without facing the targeted area.

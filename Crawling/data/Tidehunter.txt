Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
Gush becomes a ground targeted wave ability that affects enemy units in a line. Decreases cooldown.

Spell Block / Reflection Notes:Blocked upon impact.Not blocked.Modifiers [?]
modifier_tidehunter_gushAnyDuring his championship of the Sunken Isles, Leviathan gained mastery over the open sea.


The projectile travels at a speed of 2500.
Gush first applies the debuff, then the damage.
Successive debuffs do not update the armor reduction value but refresh its duration.
SCEPTER Additionally gains ground-targeting functionality. Releases a 260 radius wave, instead of a single target projectile. The wave always travels its full distance.
When unit-targeted, the wave is released toward its direction upon cast. However, it does not home in on the target.
The wave travels at a speed of 1500, taking 1.47 seconds to travel the full distance.
With the travel distance and radius, the wave can hit units up to 2460 range away.
The wave fully hits invisible and enemies inside the Fog of War.
Provides 200 radius ground vision around each hit enemy for 2 seconds. However, the wave itself does not provide any vision.
The second sound is used by the wave. Kraken Shell  Link▶️WR

Thickens Tidehunter's hide to passively block a portion of any incoming physical attack damage. The hide also removes negative status effects if the damage taken crosses a threshold. Does not stack with items that provide Damage Block.

Claddish navymen tell tales of a mighty sea-faring beast that suffered spear and sword but continued to lay waste to the fleet.


Upon reaching the damage threshold, it applies a strong dispel on Tidehunter.
The dispel proc is indicated by a sound effect and water particles on Tidehunter's skin.
When Kraken Shell is procced by an ability that first deals its damage and then applies its debuff (e.g.  Storm Hammer), Tidehunter is dispelled before the ability's debuff is applied.
Kraken Shell has an ensured Damage Block. Therefore, Damage Block with a lower value (e.g. the  Damage Block (Melee) innate ability) will not proc, since the higher damage block value takes priority.
The passive damage block is always active and it is independent of the damage threshold for the dispel proc.
Does not work against damage from wards sources (e.g.  Death Ward etc.).
Does not reduce physical damage from abilities, except for these abilities.
Only damage from player-controlled sources (after reductions) is counted towards the debuff removal.
The damage threshold counter for proccing the dispel resets when Tidehunter does not take player-based damage for 7 seconds.
TALENT Grants a stack of 4 damage block per affected enemy hero while having the  Anchor Smash debuff.
Grants a stack even if the dying hero has Reincarnation.
Treats  Meepo Clones as heroes.
However, the Anchor Smash debuff grants one stack regardless of how many Meepo Clones got the debuff.
Treats illusions, creep-heroes and the  Tempest Double as creeps.
The affected target can be killed or denied by any unit, including neutral creeps and death by self-damage. Tidehunter does not need to be credited for the kill.
The number of stacks and amount of damage block bonus granted can be seen on the status buff icon. The current damage block values can be seen in its description.
The stacks granted are retroactive before Kraken Shell or Anchor Smash is leveled up or the damage block bonus  talent is learned. Anchor Smash   Link▶️EC

modifier_tidehunter_anchor_smashAnyStolen from one of Admiral Kunkka's flagships, Leviathan's heavy anchor proves useful as a melee weapon.


Causes Tidehunter to perform instant attacks on all hit enemies within the radius.
Affects invisible units and units in the Fog of War.
Affects ancient creeps, but not wards and  Roshan.
Does not affect buildings, unless the Anchor Smash affect buildings  talent is learned.
These instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally, with cleave and the passive Anchor Smash procs being an exception. They have True Strike, but ignore disarms.
Reduces the main attack damage of affected units. Bonus attack damage is not reduced.
Anchor Smash first applies the debuff, then the instant attack.
The debuff of successive casts does not stack but refreshes the debuff duration.
TALENT
Grants  Kraken Shell a stack of 4 damage block bonus retroactively per affected enemy hero while having the Anchor Smash debuff.
Grants Anchor Smash a 50% chance to passively proc on regular attacks.
These procs do not trigger the cooldown and work while on cooldown, and do not cost mana. Therefore, they do not proc on-cast effects.
The procs use pseudo-random distribution.
The affected target(s) effectively takes 2 attacks' worth of damage, plus the attack damage bonus, since Anchor Smash deals damage based on Tidehunter's attack damage.
Adds an average of 50% current total attack damage + 22.5/45/67.5/90 ( 47.5/70/92.5/115) damage to every attack. Dead in the Water   DD

Tidehunter attaches a heavy anchor to an enemy hero. The hero is leashed while attached to the anchor. Attempting to move more than 350 units away from the anchor forces the hero to 100 move speed, dragging the anchor behind them. The anchor can be destroyed with 4 hero attacks.

Requires  Aghanim's Shard to be unlocked.
The projectile travels at a speed of 1000.
The  Anchor spawns 50-distance in front of Tidehunter.
If the cast range is greater than 350, the projectile will travel toward its target until it reaches 350-distance between the target.
Leashes the target to the Anchor, while exposing the target and provides True Sight over the affected target.
Treats illusions, clones and creep-heroes as heroes.
However, it treats attacks from clones as heroes, and attacks from creep-heroes and illusions as creeps.
Within the chain length, the Anchor always moves with the target, even when the affected target teleports, unless the affected target is dead.
Does not move upwards along with the affected target.
 Chronosphere does not prevent the Anchor from moving.
When the affected target moves more than 350 distance while leashed to the Anchor, the Anchor sets the affected target's movement speed to a fixed 100 speed, while moving together with the target.
The speed value cannot be altered in any way and it is not based on the affected target's movement speed, hence, movement speed bonuses and reductions do not affect it.
The Anchor is permanently phased and do not block neutral creep camps. Ravage Link▶️Link▶️RV

Slams the ground, causing tentacles to erupt in all directions, damaging and stunning all nearby enemy units.

Debuff Immunity Notes:The forced movement is instantly canceled.Modifiers [?]
modifier_tidehunter_ravageStrongCalling to the abyssal god Maelrawn has resulted in entire armadas being lost at sea.


The tentacles travel at a speed of 725.
Hit units are knocked up 350 range for the initial 0.5 seconds of the stun.
While in the air, other units may pass below the affected units.
The tentacle that hits the target is larger. This visual effect can also be seen in the Fog of War.
When Ravage hits invisible and untargetable units, the visual effects below the hit unit are still visible.
The damage is applied upon landing, not upon getting hit.
The damage is applied instantly if the stun is dispelled while in the air.
Ravage's effect is caused by a 250 units wide ring, which expands around the cast location at the given speed.
This means units within 250 radius upon cast are hit instantly.
The ring takes exactly 1.38 seconds to cover the remaining distance.
It can be avoided by teleporting (e.g.  Blink) towards Tidehunter over the ring shortly after cast.

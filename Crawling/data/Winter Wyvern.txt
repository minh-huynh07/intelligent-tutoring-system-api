Winter Wyvern soars upon an arctic wind, granting her unobstructed movement and allowing her to exhale a blistering chill into each attack. While soaring, her attacks travel further and faster, and slow enemies with a burning freeze that strips them of 4%/6%/8%/10% of their current health each second. Her sight is also hardened against night's chill, granting her 400 additional vision range at night while soaring.

Interrupts Winter Wyvern's channeling abilities upon cast.
Turns Winter Wyvern into a flying unit, allowing her to fly over impassable terrain, trees, units, and buildings for its duration.
However, it does not grant her flying vision.
Increases Winter Wyvern's attack range to 775/825/875/925, projectile speed to 1200,  nighttime vision range to 1200 and reduces attack point to 0.1 upon cast.
Grants attack range bonus based on the caster's attack range type.
Each enemy can only receive the debuff once per cast. Successive attacks on the same target neither stack, reapply, nor refresh the duration.
However, leveling up ability immediately update the next applied debuff, but does not affect the damage intervals.
Does not affect wards, buildings, allies and  Roshan.
The attacks first apply the debuff, then their own attack damage.
 Melee heroes do not apply the Arctic Burn debuff since the ability relies on attack projectiles to apply the debuff.
Deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after the debuff is placed, resulting in 5 ( 8) instances.
Can deal up to 18%/27%/34%/41% ( 28%/39%/49%/57%) of the target's current health as damage (before reductions), assuming nothing else affects the target's health.
Despite the damage per second being current-health based, it is still lethal.
Destroys trees within a 175 radius at the end of the duration.
SCEPTER Turns Arctic Burn into a toggle ability, and it no longer interrupts Winter Wyvern's channeling abilities upon toggling On / Off.
Removes the one debuff per target limit, successive attacks now reapply and refresh the debuff on the same target. This is determined if Winter Wyvern has  Aghanim's Scepter equipped upon the attack projectile connecting with the affected target.
Activating the ability now costs 100 mana.
Arctic Burn now drains Winter Wyvern's mana in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after toggling.
If toggled On, Arctic Burn continues working even when silenced, disabled, or hidden.

Launches a ball of brittle ice towards an enemy. The ice shatters on impact, leaving the primary target completely unaffected, while hurling damaging splinters into nearby enemies in a 500 base radius. Enemies struck by these splinters are slowed by 30%.

The initial projectile travels at a speed between 750 – 4000. It adapts so that it reaches the target in 1 second.
This means when the target gets more than 4000 range away on cast, it takes more than 1 second to reach it.
Vice versa, if the target gets closer than 750 range on cast, it takes less than 1 second to reach it.
However, the secondary projectiles travel at a speed of 1000.
Fully affects invisible and units in the Fog of War.
The splinters first apply the damage, the debuff, then the stun.
TALENT The Splinter Blast stun  talent only affects the secondary targets, like the damage and slow.
The stun does not replace the slow. The slow is still applied, effectively slowing hit units for 2.5 seconds. Cold Embrace Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️EE

Ability Draft Notes:
 Splinter Blast must be drafted as well for it to get applied.
From winter's heart comes a cold, healing embrace. The ice slows the blood and allows the spell to better work its curative magic.


Cannot be cast on allies who have ☐ Disabled Help from Winter Wyvern.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
Stuns the allied target and turns it immune to physical damage. The target can still be attacked and affected by other damage types.
Heals for 10/11.25/12.5/13.75 ( 16.25/17.5/18.75/20) + 0.56%/0.75%/0.84%/1.13% max health in 0.25-second intervals, starting 0.25 seconds after the buff is placed, resulting in 16 instances.
Can heal up to 160/180/200/220 ( 260/280/300/320) + 9%/12%/13.5%/18% of a unit's max health over its full duration.
SHARD Losing the Cold Embrace buff in any way now causes  Splinter Blast secondary projectiles to be released based on its current level.
Splinter Blast notes fully apply. If it is not learned, no projectiles are released.
Splinters released this way do not require vision, and can target invisible units and units inside the Fog of War.
However, unlike the projectiles of a regular cast, these projectiles are disjointed by invisibility.
The projectiles still hit untargetable unit. This behaviour is similar to the AoE cast of  Shadow Strike. Winter's Curse  Link▶️RW

AffectsEnemies


Winter Wyvern dispells then freezes an enemy in place while striking those nearby with a maddening curse which causes them to attack their frozen ally with increased attack speed. The frozen ally and those cursed to attack their ally are immune to all damage from their enemies with the exception of magic and pure damage from Winter Wyvern or her controlled units, that is amplified.

modifier_winter_wyvern_winters_curseDeathThe oldest of the bookwurm's spells, this curse lends truth to the old saw: sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my enemy still.


Winter's Curse first applies a basic dispel on the affected target, then the stun.
Stuns and provides True Sight over the target, while the affected target's allies within the radius are taunted, forcing them to attack the primary target.
Enemies that enter the radius after cast are also taunted for its remaining duration.
If no valid enemies are within 525 radius for a total of 2.5 seconds, the debuff gets removed.
Neither affects nor checks for spell immune, invulnerable, or hidden enemies, wards or buildings within the radius.
Only affects units allied to the target. This means when cast on an enemy, neutral creeps are not taunted, and vice versa.
Despite not getting taunted when targeting an enemy, neutral creeps still prevent the curse debuff from being removed prematurely.
Cannot be cast on  Couriers.
The taunt is based on an aura, with an infinite linger duration. The debuff gets cleared when the debuff on the primary target expires, or when the target dies.
Has the same taunt priority with  Berserker's Call,  Little Friends and   Life Break, but lower than  Duel.
This means the taunt sticks on the affected units, and getting moved outside the radius does not free the unit from the taunt.
This also means the taunt lingers even if the debuff is removed on the primary target due to no enemies within the area.
The taunt area is centered on the primary target and follows them when they are affected by other forced movement sources.
Applies the following  incoming damage manipulation on affected enemy targets within the radius. Stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation.
100%  damage reduction against the following sources:
All physical attack damage and spell damage sources.
Magical attack damage sources (e.g.  Pierce).
Does not reduce pure attack damage sources.
30%  damage amplification against the following sources:
All magical spell damage sourced from Winter Wyvern (e.g.  Arctic Burn,  Splinter Blast), from item abilities, from her player-controlled units. This is not limited to only Winter Wyvern's basic abilities.
Pure attack damage sources (e.g.  Death Ward's attacks against the primary target).
Does not amplify magical attack damage sources.
Since other generic  incoming damage amplification sources (e.g.  Flesh Golem) stack additively with Winter's Curse, it can be used to counter the effect, causing the affected units to receive damage.
However, it does not reduce the damage flagged as HP Removal.
Winter's Curse has a lower priority than  Reaper's Scythe, but higher than  Little Friends, in the group of kill credit manipulation effects.
All damage dealt to the affected target, including from allies, during the taunt duration is sourced to Winter's Curse, and credited to Winter Wyvern.
Even when the taunt duration expires, the kill is also credited to Winter Wyvern if the allied projectile kills the affected target.
When combined with other kill credit manipulation effects (e.g.  Reaper's Scythe), Reaper's Scythe takes priority instead.
However, the following conditions do not credit Winter Wyvern with the kill credit:
When the affected target is brought into   Supernova during the taunt duration.
Forced Kill sources applied to the affected target during the taunt duration.
When the affected target dies from  Ice Blast's max health percentage kill threshold.
When the affected target enters   Wraith Delay.
Does not disable any abilities. However, most passive abilities do not affect allied units.
When the primary target dies, the taunt effect ends immediately.

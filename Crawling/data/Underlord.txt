The visual and audio effects at the targeted area during the cast point are visible and audible to allies only.
Creates 6 ( 9) waves in 1-second ( 0.75-second) intervals, starting immediately upon cast, resulting in duration of 5 ( 6) seconds.
Despite the visual effects, the damage is applied instantly, and not upon the waves landing.
On each wave, Firestorm first applies the damage, then the debuff.
Does not place the burn debuff on  Roshan, but does apply the wave damage.
The burn debuff deals damage in 1-second (0.75-second) intervals, starting immediately as the debuff is applied, resulting in 3 instances.
The burn debuff does not stack per interval. Each interval refreshes its duration, resulting in 8 ( 11) possible instances.
Can deal up to 180/300/420/540 + 12%/16%/20%/24% ( 18.4%/22.4%/26.4%/30.4%) of max health as damage (before reductions) when all waves hit.

SHARD Adds unit-targeting functionality to the ability, all effects now stay centered on the affected unit, following the target as it moves, and continues at its corpse's location upon death.

The visual and audio effects at the targeted area during the cast point are visible and audible to allies only.
Roots the targets, preventing them from moving and casting certain mobility abilities.
Fully affects invisible units and units inside the Fog of War.
Provides True Sight over the targets.
The root is applied periodically to every enemy within the area.
However, the hidden modifier prevents them from being continuously rooted for the whole duration.
This hidden modifier is applied to every unit within the area which does not have the modifier yet. The modifier lasts for 20/30/40/50 seconds.
Whenever the modifier expires, enemies get instantly rooted again, and then the hidden modifier is reapplied again.
This means that Pit of Malice does not root every unit within the area in set intervals. Each unit is rooted every 20/30/40/50 seconds based on when they entered the area.
The hidden modifier does not disappear upon leaving the area. Quickly leaving and re-entering does not result in an instant root.
All pits share the same modifier, therefore the root does not stack — once rooted, the unit becomes immune to all other pits until the modifier wears off.
Can root a unit up to 4 times if it stays within the area for the full duration, resulting in a total root time of 4.8/5.6/6.4/7.2 ( 17///) seconds.
Creates a distinct visual effect around, and plays a distinct sound on affected heroes and illusions, but not around other affected units.
SCEPTER Increases Pit of Malice radius by 500.

AbilityAura

Nearby enemy units are weakened, losing a portion of their base damage. If an enemy dies while under this effect, Underlord gains temporary bonus damage.

Reduces the main attack damage of affected units. Bonus attack damage is not reduced.
The aura does not affect invulnerable or hidden units, and its debuff lingers for 0.5 seconds.
Does not affect enemies which have no vision over Underlord.
However, Underlord still gains attack damage from dying enemies within the radius, despite the debuff not being present.
Grants flat bonus attack damage as long as the dying enemy unit was affected by the debuff, regardless of how it dies.
Grants a stack of attack damage bonus when there are multiple  Meepo Clones within the radius.
Does not grant bonus attack damage from dying illusions, buildings, wards,  Undying Zombies,  Couriers and the  Tempest Double.
Does not grant bonus attack damage if he is invulnerable or hidden as the enemy dies.
Each stack places a new buff on Underlord. This means their durations are independent of each other, gaining a new stack does not refresh the existing stacks.
Treats creep-heroes as creeps.
A status buff is visible on the HUD, showing the current amount of bonus attack damage the aura currently grants.
Underlord's weapon also glows stronger with green particle effects the more damage stacks he has.
TALENT Atrophy Aura now grants 50% of the bonus attack damage to all allied heroes, including illusions, clones, and creep-heroes within its radius.
However, the bonus attack damage is not provided by an aura, it is placed as an expiring buff on allies.
It uses the same modifiers for allies as it does for Underlord, so they work exactly the same.
Affected allies gain 15/17.5/20/22.5 bonus attack damage per dying hero and 1/2/3/4 bonus attack damage per dying non-hero units. Fiend's Gate Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️RD

Notes

Invulnerable Minimap icon



The exit portal must not be within 2000 radius of Underlord.
A red range indicator around Underlord indicates the restricted area.
The portals cannot be placed inside the fountain areas, including the ramps, or inside  Roshan's pit.
Cannot be placed on impassable terrain, or spots obscured by buildings or trees.
Upon cast, allies and enemies get a ‼ Ping on their minimap, showing where the portals are placed.
Fiend's Gate can be cast without having to face toward the targeted point.
The portals have distinct icons  on the minimap. It is colored green if Underlord is an ally, and red if he is an enemy.
Both portals face each other when created, their particle effects point towards each other, indicating in which direction the other portal lies.
Destroy trees and provides flying vision within 200 radius around the portals upon spawning.
The portals gain their  Spell Immunity through a buff, allowing enemies to ‼ Ping it to display their remaining duration.
Underlord immediately starts channeling the teleport upon cast. This can be canceled by the player.
Applies a generic incoming damage reduction buff on affected ally units upon teleporting. Stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation.
Affects all damage types the affected ally units receive. Does not reduce damage flagged as HP removal.
SCEPTER Fiend's Gate now creates  Pits of Malice based on its current level centered on both portals.
Pit of Malice's notes fully apply. If it is not leveled, no pits are spawned. Warp Link▶️



AbilityPassive  / Channeled



There is no description for this ability.

Cast Animation: 0+0Channel Distance: 300Channel Time: 3.5Pull Stop Distance: 100Root Notes:Cannot initiate channeling while rooted or leashed.Does not get interrupted when getting rooted or leashed while already channeling.Modifiers [?]modifier_underlord_portal_warp_channelAny



If the channeling is interrupted, the ability does nothing.
Performing a  Right Click on a Fiend's Gate causes the hero to begin channeling.
The channeling can be initiated by heroes, clones, illusions that can cast abilities,  Warlock Golems, and  Familiars.
Other units cannot initiate the teleport, including the  Spirit Bear, and  Primal Split spirits.
The channeling can be initiated even while disarmed or silenced.
The channeling also does not get interrupted by getting disarmed or silenced during it.
While channeling, the unit gets moved towards the Fiend's Gate until it is within 100 range of it.
The pull duration is fixed at 3.5 seconds, so the pull speed depends on the distance upon channel begin.
Dispelling the modifier stops this movement and removes the particle effects, but the channeling is not canceled.
While channeling, the other Fiend's Gate plays its channeling animation and channelnig sounds as well.
Upon successfully channeling, the unit gets teleported to the other Fiend's Gate.
Does not disjoint projectiles upon teleporting.
Does not interrupt ⇧ Shift-queue orders upon teleporting.
Multiple units can channel at the same time, each working independently.

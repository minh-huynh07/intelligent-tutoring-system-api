modifier_chen_penitenceAnyAlthough Chen's brand of animal enthrallment isn't quite strong enough to control the minds of enemy heroes, it still tests their resolve in combat.


The projectile travels at a speed of 1400.
Grants the allied unit that is attacking the debuffed enemy the attack speed buff upon its attack point (i.e. starting an attack).
This includes invulnerable and hidden units, as well as buildings and wards.
The buff is granted even if the attacks missed or changing targets after the attack point.
Once gained, the buff stays for its full duration, so it can be used against other targets.
Does not apply to instant attacks.
When leveling up the ability while a cast is already active, the ability values on already affected units do not update to the new values.
Successive casts also do not update existing ability values but refresh the duration.
Penitence first applies the debuff, then the damage.
Chen has a total of 700/800/900/1000 attack range against the affected target.
Grants Chen and his controlled ranged units attack range bonus as long as they are attacking the affected unit with attack range bonus buff, regardless of its source.
Does not work against illusions. Holy Persuasion  Link▶️Link▶️WT

Ability Draft Notes:
Checks for the current level of the ultimate ability drafted by the player, instead of checking specifically for  Hand of God.
Although they may not be knights, Chen incorporates beasts into the Fold in the same way he himself was converted.


Applies a basic dispel on the target which removes buffs and debuffs.
Grants the creep's Gold  bounty like a regular last hit upon cast.
Persuading a new creep while already having the maximum amount of creeps instantly kills the oldest persuaded creep.
The death is not credited to anyone so that no one gets experience from it.
Cannot persuade  Roshan,  Siege Creeps,  Couriers,  Necronomicon Units, creep-heroes and ancient creeps.
The creep(s)' abilities' levels are based on the time persuaded and do not upgrade.
SHARD Increases the creep(s)' abilities' level by 1 based on the time persuaded and does not upgrade. For a full list of neutral creep abilities that are upgradeable, please refer to the chart below.
The following neutral creeps cannot be persuaded due to the level restriction:
LEVEL 4 Can persuade all neutral creeps.
LEVEL 3 Cannot persuade:  Ancient Black Dragon,   Ancient Granite Golem,   Ancient Ice Shaman,   Ancient Thunderhide,   Dark Troll Summoner,   Satyr Tormenter
LEVEL 2 Additionally unpersuadable:  Alpha Wolf,   Ancient Frostbitten Golem,   Ancient Rock Golem,   Ancient Rumblehide,   Centaur Conqueror,   Hellbear Smasher,   Mega Ranged Creep,   Ranged Creep,   Super Ranged Creep,   Warpine Raider,   Wildwing Ripper
LEVEL 1 Additionally unpersuadable:  Hellbear,   Mud Golem,   Satyr Mindstealer,   Shard Golem
When the creep's max health is below the minimum health threshold, its current and max health are increased by the difference.
This counts as setting health and does not count as a heal.
Leveling the ability or the min health increasing  talent does not update the health of already persuaded creeps.
Fully restores the creep's mana upon persuading by setting mana.
Grants flat bonus attack damage to the persuaded creeps.
 Reinforced units receive  10% less damage (before reductions) from persuaded creeps.
SCEPTER Acquiring  Aghanim's Scepter retroactively grants the  Martyrdom ability to the persuaded creeps.
Does not require  Hand of God to be leveled to be unlocked, once Aghanim's Scepter is acquired.
However, it relies on Hand of God to work, since it directly uses its values. This means when Hand of God is not learned, Martyrdom does nothing upon cast.
SHARD Ancient creeps can now be persuaded, with a max of 1/2/3 ancient creeps per level of  Hand of God.
Ancient creeps are included in the max units count as well, so it does not allow Chen to have more creeps persuaded.
When persuading an ancient creep while already having the maximum amount of ancient creeps, the oldest persuaded ancient creep dies.
If Hand of God is not learned, Holy Persuasion can still be cast on ancient creeps, but it does nothing, wasting the mana and cooldown.
With Level 4 Holy Persuasion, Chen can persuade the following number of creeps and ancient creeps on each level of  Hand of God:
LEVEL 1 Max 3 creep(s) with 1 ancient creep(s).
LEVEL 2 Max 2 creep(s) with 2 ancient creep(s).
LEVEL 3 Max 1 creep(s) with 3 ancient creep(s).

SPELL STEAL Persuaded units are killed upon losing ability.  The max number of persuaded ancient creeps is based on  Chen's current  Hand of God level when acquired.
MORPH NOTES Persuaded units are killed upon losing ability. Divine Favor  EF

Ability Draft Notes:
Requires drafting  Hand of God to be unlocked for the  Persuaded Unit.



Requires  Aghanim's Scepter and  Hand of God to be leveled to be unlocked.
This ability is granted to the  Persuaded Creeps once Aghanim's Scepter is acquired.
If the caster does not have Hand of God, nothing happens upon cast.
When losing Aghanim's Scepter, the ability disappears immediately from the persuaded creeps.
The initial damage and damage per second component is sourced to Chen, and not to the persuaded unit.
Therefore, the damage is affected by outgoing damage manipulation and spell lifesteal.
Although Martyrdom uses Hand of God's ability values, amplifying or reducing the healing value neither affects the impact damage nor the damage per second component.
Deals damage in 1-second intervals, 1 second after cast, the impact damage is applied together with the first damage per second instance, resulting in 8 damage instances.
Uses the same debuff with Hand of God's buff, therefore it can replace the buff which is recevived before.
Martyrdom's cooldown is shared among all persuaded units.
It is possible to have different cooldown values if another unit is persuaded after Martyrdom is cast.
Cannot be cast on invulnerable units and  Couriers.
Fully affect ancient creeps.
↓↓ Double-tapping instantly kills the persuaded unit.
The death is not credited to anyone so that no one gets experience from it.
The cooldown is shared between all persuaded units.
Hand of God notes fully apply.
This ability is not acquirable by  Devour.

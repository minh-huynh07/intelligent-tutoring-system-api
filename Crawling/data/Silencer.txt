Whenever an affected unit casts an ability, the duration is increased by 2 seconds. The penalty duration has no stack limit.
Fully ignores abilities that do not trigger on-cast effects (e.g. active attack modifiers and toggleable-abilities).
Deals damage in 1-second intervals, starting 1 second after the debuff is applied, resulting in 6 + 2 per penalty instances.
Can deal up to 116/184/252/320 + 32/48/64/80 per penalty ( 176/244/312/380 + 52/68/84/100 per penalty) damage to a single unit (before reductions).
If an affected unit gets silenced, the debuff duration is suspended and the damage and slow values are multiplied by 1.5 until the silence expires.
The cooldown in the ability description refers to the debuff countdown instead of the ability's cooldown.
Suspends the duration by increasing the debuff's duration by 1 second on each interval.
Slows movement speed by 15%/22.5%/30%/37.5% for silenced units.
Deals an additional 24/36/48/60 ( 39/51/63/75) damage per second to silenced units.
The initial damage is not amplified if the target was silenced when Arcane Curse was cast.
Successive casts of Arcane Curse fully stack, with each cast placing a debuff independent of each other.
The sound effect played on every damage instance is only audible to the affected unit's player. Glaives of Wisdom     Link▶️Link▶️WW

modifier_silenceAnyAlthough lacking in traditional incantations, Nortrom's pedigree of the Aeol Drias gives him uncanny wisdom, which he applies to physical combat.


Glaives of Wisdom's cast range can only be further increased by attack range bonuses of the same range type as the caster. It is not affected by cast range bonuses.
Both Autocast and manually casting it uses Silencer's current attack range.
The bonus damage is dealt in a separate damage instance, and counts as spell damage.
This means it is not affected or considered by anything that works with attack damage.
This also means that it fully works with spell damage amplification and spell lifesteal.
Glaives of Wisdom neither work against nor bounce to allies,  Couriers, buildings or wards.
Checks Silencer's  intelligence upon projectile hit, so changes in his intelligence while the projectile flies affect its damage.
Glaives of Wisdom first steal intelligence, and applies its spell damage, then the attack damage.
Therefore, the stolen intelligence affects the glaives' damage right away but still depends on the attack hitting the target.
The temporary intelligence steal cannot reduce enemy intelligence below 0, but Silencer always gains the full amount of intelligence, no matter how much the target has left.
Treat clones as heroes, and illusions as creeps.
Reduces the target's current mana by 12/12/24/36 ( 36/36/48/60), instead of keeping the current mana percentage.
This lost mana is returned upon the debuff expiring.
The target also effectively loses 0.05/0.05/0.1/0.15 ( 0.15/0.15/0.2/0.25) mana regeneration, and 1/1/2/3 ( 3/3/4/5) main attack damage if it is an intelligence hero.
Vice versa, it temporarily increases Silencer's mana, mana regeneration, and main attack damage by the same amount per cast.
Unlike the target, Silencer keeps his current mana percentage upon gaining and losing the temporary intelligence.
Each attack places a new hidden modifier buff/debuff on both Silencer and the target. This means their durations are independent from each other.
The counter modifiers on both Silencer and his targets show how much intelligence they gained or lost.
Upon death, the dying hero's intelligence restores back to its normal values, while Silencer keeps the bonus intelligence values for the remaining duration.
Permanently stolen  intelligence is removed from the enemy's base intelligence and added to Silencer's base intelligence.
A +2 ( +4) appears above Silencer's head, indicating that he stole the enemy's intelligence.
The number of stolen intelligence gained/lost can be seen on the status buff icon.
Does not permanently steal intelligence if the enemy hero has Reincarnation, is an illusion, from the  Tempest Double.
Grants a stack in the following conditions as long as Silencer or the owner of the ability is alive:
The enemy hero(es) dying within the 925 steal radius, including denied enemy heroes.
To permanently steal intelligence outside the steal radius, Silencer has to be credited for the kill. Other player-controlled units do not count.
When  Meepo or its  Meepo Clones is instantly killed due to either the Prime or any one of its clones dying, only the Prime gets its intelligence stolen.
The permanent intelligence steal cannot reduce enemy base intelligence below 1. Silencer also does not gain intelligence from heroes that are at 1 intelligence.
Enemy heroes effectively lose 24 ( 48) mana, 0.1 ( 0.2) mana regeneration, and 2 ( 4) main attack damage if it is an intelligence hero.
Vice versa, it permanently increases Silencer's mana, mana regeneration, and main attack damage by the same amount per stack.
The permanent intelligence steal is not retroactive, it cannot gain charges from kills and deaths before Glaives of Wisdom is learned.
SHARD Each successful attack with Glaives of Wisdom adds 1 to the attack counting buff.
Glaives of Wisdom gain 1 charge when the projectile impact the main attack target. It does not count any hit by the Glaives Bounces talent.
The buff is always present, but it is hidden when at 0 charges.
Neither count attacks done against allies, wards or buildings, nor triggers on the attack applying the silence.
Once the counter reaches 3, Silencer gains the attack buff.
The buff causes the next Glaives of Wisdom attack to apply a 1.75-second silence onto the all affected targets.
As Silencer is a ranged attacker, this buff remain active until a Glaives of Wisdom projectile impacts and applies the silence. This means the attack buff can affect more than 1 Glaives of Wisdom attack.
Attacks with this buff reset the counter and do not increase it.
Neither the charges nor the attack buff has a duration and last indefinitely.
For Silencer to continuously silence his attack target, he must have ≥ 366 attack speed or have an attack time of ≤ 0.44s (before status resistance reductions).
Note that as Silencer is a ranged attacker, there is variation in the attack projectiles spawning position around Silencer. So these values are not absolute.
The movement of the target/its relative distance to Silencer also affect the impact timing of the projectile.
TALENT Glaives of Wisdom now bounces towards the closest enemy unit within 500 range of the attack target.
If the projectile is unable to impact the main attack target (due to evasion, attack immunity, invulnerability...), it also does not bounce.
The bouncing glaives travel at the same speed as the leading attack projectile.
The projectile speed can be further increased by other attack projectile speed bonuses.
Does not bounce back to the same unit if it already hit all other nearby units. Cannot bounce on invisible enemies or enemies in the Fog of War.
TALENT Like normal Glaives of Wisdom hits, the bouncing projectiles deal 2 damage instances: a physical instance and an intelligence-based magic damage instance. However, they are not instant attacks.
The magic damage instance is functionally identical to a normal Glaives of Wisdom hit.
The physical damage instance is a physical spell damage instance with following properties:
Do not trigger any attack modifier or on-hit effects, and ignore evasion.
Affected by damage block sources and  Bulwark, but not  Resonant Pulse.
Has the following flags:
No-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing their damage from utilizing spell lifesteal.
No-spell-amplification flag, preventing their damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification.
Is equal to damage amount calculated for the leading attack, which is determined upon attack begin.
This means it works with critical strike and quell, since these are included in the initial damage calculations.
This also means that it does not matter how much damage the attack actually did to the target, since that part is being calculated on projectile hit.
It also means that other conditional attack damage bonuses (i.e.  Javelin damage proc) are not included, since these happen later in the calculations as well. Last Word  Link▶️ET

modifier_silencer_last_word_disarmAnyNortrom ensures that spells uttered by his opponents will be their last.


When the target casts an ability during the 4 seconds initial debuff duration, the target gets damaged, then silenced and muted, and then the cast ability takes effect.
Although the silence happens first, the ability's effects are already queued up, therefore the silence does not prevent the target from casting the ability.
However death does stop the ability, meaning if the damage from Last Word is enough to kill the target, the cast ability does not go off.
This means that damage negating sources (e.g.  Refraction) do not block Last Word's damage.
TALENT Last Word mutes items only when the affected target is silenced.
Fully ignores abilities that do not trigger on-cast effects (e.g. active attack modifiers and toggle-abilities).
Triggers on channeling abilities, but waits for the channel to stop first.
With  Phase Shift and  Tricks of the Trade, Last Word only applies its effects when the ability is canceled by the player prematurely.
This means if the aforementioned abilities expire on their own, Last Word's damage and silence are not applied.
 Solar Guardian and  Dissimilate does not trigger any aspects of Last Word.
When the initial debuff expires, it still damages and silences the target.
Last Word first applies the debuff, then the damage.
Deals the base damage and Silencer's current  intelligence to units without attributes (e.g. lane creeps).
The initial debuff provides shared vision over the target for its duration.
SCEPTER Last Word turns into an area-targeted ability, so that it cannot directly target units anymore.
Can target invisible and untargetable units and units inside the Fog of War. Global Silence Link▶️Link▶️RE

Affects invisible and invulnerable units as well.
Does not affect  Couriers and hidden units.
The sound effect of Global Silence which plays on each enemy's hero has the highest sound priority in the game.
This means it heavily tones down other game sounds for enemies, making it basically the only sound they can hear during the silence.

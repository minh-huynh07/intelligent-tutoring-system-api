The Pangolier's blade is even nimbler than his tongue.


Casting Swashbuckle during  Rolling Thunder immediately cancels Rolling Thunder.
Pangolier dashes towards the targeted point at a speed of 2000. Can dash over impassable terrain and through trees.
After the dash, Pangolier performs 4 slashes towards the targeted direction.
Slashes in 0.1-second intervals, starting immediately upon reaching the target point, taking 0.3 seconds in total.
During the dash and the 4 slashes, Pangolier is fully disabled and prevented from acting.
Causes Pangolier to perform instant attacks on all hit enemies.
These instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers (e.g.  Lucky Shot) and on-hit effects normally. They have True Strike, and completely ignore disarms.
Swashbuckle does not trigger damage block.
Cleave effects are based on the hit enemies position, damaging a trapezoid area the opposite direction where the attacks came from.
Despite the audio, the slashes do not hit ethereal units, so that attack modifiers may not proc.
Also applies an instant attack on each enemy Pangolier directly dashes through.
If the caster is a  ranged hero, the instant attacks do not use attack projectiles and are instant, but still count as ranged attacks.
Sets Pangolier's damage to the given values. This means all other forms of attack damage changes are completely ignored.
Conditional attack damage bonuses (e.g. Bash sources or  Javelin) still apply their damage.
All slashes together can deal up to 100/180/260/340 ( 160/240/320/400) damage per hit enemy (before reductions).
TALENT The damage increasing  talent immediately updates the remaining slashes of the current cast of Swashbuckle.
The slashes can hit units up to 1140 ( 1390) range away from Pangolier after the dash.
With the cast range, slash range, and slash width, it can hit units up to 1540/1690/1840/1990 ( 1790/1940/2090/2240) range away. Shield Crash  Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️WC

Pangolier jumps in the air and slams back to the ground in front of his current position, damaging and slowing all enemies in a radius. For each enemy hero hit, he gains an all damage shield for a short time.Forward movement is maintained if Shield Crash is used while Rolling Thunder is active, and allows Rolling Thunder to clear walls or cliffs.

modifier_pangolier_shield_crash_slowAnyAbility Draft Notes:
 Swashbuckle must be drafted as well for it to get applied.
Only in the midst of his enemies does the Pangolier truly thrive.


Pangolier jumps 225 range forwards upon cast, 250 range upwards. While in the air, other units can pass below him.
Interrupts Pangolier's channeling abilities upon cast.
During the short jump, Pangolier is fully disabled and prevented from acting.
The actual length of the jump depends on the terrain, jumping onto a higher/lower ground affects the duration of the jump, without affecting the jump distance.
The area damage hits all enemies within range, but the buff only counts hit heroes, clones and the  Spirit Bear.
Treats illusions and other creep-heroes as creeps.
Grants Pangolier a  universal damage barrier per affected hero within the radius that absorbs damage values of all damage types, causing several on-damage effects to not trigger within its capacity.
Stacks additively with the same damage-type barrier sources, and independently with other damage-type barrier sources.
Universal damage barrier has the lowest priority in the group of damage barriers, its capacity is depleted last when combined with other damage-type barriers.
However, when combined with other higher-priority damage-negating sources (e.g.  Refraction), Shield Crash does not absorb any damage until the damage-negation sources expire.
The five circling shields' visual effect around Pangolier has three different states, based on how many heroes were hit.
With 1 or 2 enemies hit, the shields are small and have no extra effects.
With 3 enemies hit, the shields are larger and gain a light yellow flame-like effect.
With 4 or more enemies hit, the yellow flame gets much stronger.
Successive casts refresh the duration and update the damage barrier capacity per enemy hero affected.
If Pangolier is stunned mid-jump, he does not apply the damage or gain the  universal damage barrier buff upon landing.
During  Rolling Thunder and  Roll Up, Shield Crash behaves differently and moves Pangolier only vertically, and not horizontally.
Pangolier is not disabled when jumping during those abilities.
Due to how vertical and horizontal movement stack with each other, it does not interfere with abilities that move Pangolier on the x and y-axis.
When cast during Rolling Thunder, he effectively jumps in an arc, with a max height of 350 and the velocity of Rolling Thunder.
When cast during Roll Up, he effectively jumps at a height of 350.
When Rolling Thunder or Roll Up expires during the jump of Shield Crash, their duration gets expanded based on the jump's duration, so that the velocity is kept until landing.
However, when Rolling Thunder or Roll Up are ended manually during the jump, via their  End Roll Up or  Stop Rolling sub-abilities, the velocity is lost, so that Pangolier falls straight down.
Has a cast backswing of 0.54 during Rolling Thunder and Roll Up.
Sets the cooldown to 9/6/3s depending on  Rolling Thunder's level whenever Roll Up or Rolling Thunder is active. Fully affects current cooldowns as well.
SCEPTER  Swashbuckle of the current level is applied instantly upon cast, not upon landing.
The location of the effect is set upon cast as well and does not follow Pangolier.
The angle is based on Pangolier's facing angle, with the other Swashbuckles being 90° apart from each other.
Swashbuckle applied this way neither prevents Pangolier from acting nor cancels  Rolling Thunder.
Swashbuckle notes fully apply. If it is not leveled, it is not applied.
All slashes together can deal up to 50/90/130/170 ( 80/120/160/200) damage per hit enemy (before reductions).
SPELL STEAL The passive  Swashbuckle applied is based on  Pangolier's current ability level when acquired. Lucky Shot   Link▶️Link▶️EE

Pangolier rolls the dice and lets fate decide the outcome for his enemies. Grants a chance to drastically slow their attack speed and reduce armor on any damage dealt by Pangolier's attacks or abilities.

modifier_pangolier_luckyshot_disarmAnyThe Pangolier's blade is guided more often by whim than reason.


Lucky Shot procs in the following conditions:
Whenever any of Pangolier's abilities, including Spell Reflection sources, deal an instance of damage to enemies (before reductions).
Even while Pangolier's attacks or abilities deal an instance of 0 damage.
All of Pangolier's spell damage instances first apply the debuff, then the ability's own damage.
For Pangolier's attacks, the proccing attack first applies the debuff, then its own damage.
Lucky Shot procs are determined during Pangolier's attack point, therefore it is possible that the debuff can be applied before the target becomes debuff immune despite the not piercing debuff immunity.
Successive procs on the same target do not stack but refresh the duration.
Does not proc in the following conditions:
On allies.
On both active and passive item abilities.
On damage with the HP Removal flags and Instant Kill sources.
Lucky Shot uses pseudo-random distribution. Roll Up  Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️DD

For better readability, the turn rate during Roll Up is given as degrees per second, instead of radians per 0.03 seconds.
275° degrees per second equal a turn rate of 0.144.
Pangolier does not roll during Roll Up unless the attack of a hero lands on him.
Treats attacks from illusions and clones as heroes, and creep-heroes as creeps.
In this case, he rolls with a speed of 600 for 0.75 seconds, in the opposite direction of the attacking hero's current location.
The rolling behaves in the exact same way as  Rolling Thunder, all of its rolling-related notes fully apply.
 Shield Crash has a cast backswing of 0.54 and behaves the same as how it does during Rolling Thunder.
Roll Up can be cast during Rolling Thunder without interrupting it.
When done, causes Rolling Thunder to stop rolling and stop applying its area effects. Its duration gets paused as well.

Grants debuff immunity and  magic resistance bonus for the duration, and applies a basic dispel upon cast.

Increases Pangolier’s magic resistance to 62.5%.
With the magic resistance bonus from this source, every 10 points of  intelligence further increases the total magic resistance by 0.5%. [?]
During Rolling Thunder, Pangolier does not need to turn to cast abilities or items.
Casting  Swashbuckle immediately cancels Rolling Thunder.
 Shield Crash has a cast backswing of 0.54 during Rolling Thunder.
 Roll Up can be cast during Rolling Thunder without interrupting it.
For better readability, the turn rate during Rolling Thunder is given as degrees per second, instead of radians per 0.03 seconds.
120° per second equal a turn rate of 0.063.
The turn rate is boosted by an additional 165° upon beginning to roll, upon hitting a cliff or wall, or upon landing after casting Shield Crash.
This boost lasts for 0.25 seconds. It effectively increases the turn rate to 0.149 for that time.
Pangolier turns for a maximum of 1 second per issued move order. This means a single move order does not cause him to move in a circle around the targeted point.
Pangolier's final path and direction pre-move order depends on a vector from Pangolier's position to the targeted point, which is always parallel with the path.
Upon colliding with impassable terrain, Pangolier stops for 0.2 seconds and then starts rolling in the direction he came from.
Can also collide with pathing blockers (e.g.  Power Cogs).
When colliding with trees, they get destroyed instead and Pangolier continues rolling without stopping.
Does not collide with buildings or wards, he simply rolls through them.
Moves Pangolier towards the direction he is currently facing with a fixed 550 speed.
The speed value cannot be altered in any way and it is not based on Pangolier's movement speed, hence, movement speed bonuses and reductions do not affect it.
Every enemy coming within 150 range of Pangolier while rolling gets damaged, knocked back, and stunned.
The damage and knockback happen immediately on contact. The stun is applied right after the knockback, although the knockback itself is disabling as well.
Enemies are knocked 150 range away from Pangolier over 0.6 seconds. Can knock enemies over impassable terrain.
Also knocks affected enemies 50 range upwards, resulting in a small arc.
This means the disable lasts a total of 1.4/1.6/1.8 seconds.
The timeout debuff prevents units from getting hit by Rolling Thunder again. Its duration equals the combined duration of the knockback and the stun. The duration cannot be altered and is not affected by status resistance sources.
Does not affect  Roshan.
Rolling Thunder first applies the damage, then the debuffs. Stop Rolling RR

Besides attacking, Pangolier can perform any and all actions without requiring to be facing toward his targets.

This is innate to Pangolier and does not need to be learned.
However, Pangolier still turns and uses his turn rate for all actions that require facing, except for targeted items (e.g.  Force), despite not needing it.

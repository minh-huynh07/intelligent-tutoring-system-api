     Link▶️ Chicken model  
Applies a hex on the target, setting its base movement speed to 100, while silencing, muting, disarming and applying Break to it.
However, the target's movement speed can still be affected by movement speed bonuses from items and abilities.
Hex does not apply movement speed slow. Therefore, all movement speed increasing and reducing effects are calculated using the 100 base speed.
Applies generic incoming damage amplification on the hexed target.
Stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation.
Affects all damage types the target receives. Does not amplify damage flagged as HP removal.
Hex instantly destroys illusions.
Treat strong illusions as heroes.
Shadow Shaman's Hex transforms the target into a chicken.

modifier_shadow_shaman_shacklesStrongAbility Draft Notes:
 Mass Serpent Ward must be drafted as well for  Serpent Wards to spawn.
A self-defense incantation, Rhasta developed shackles after his master was slain in the Bleeding Hills.


Stuns the target as long as the channeling time.
If the target turns invulnerable or hidden, the channeling stops instantly.
Provides True Sight over the target as long as the channeling time.
It also provides 200 radius caster vision of the Shackled target for 2.4/3/3.6/4.2 seconds, even after it is canceled.
Deals damage in 0.1-second intervals, starting immediately as the channel begins, resulting in 24/30/36/42 ( 34/40/46/52) damage instances.
The damage per interval can be defined as expr ΣShacklesDamage / MaxChannelTime / (1 / 0.1).
The duration increasing bonus from the  talent is ignored.
This results in 3.125/5/6.25/7.143 ( 10.208/10.667/10.972/11.19) damage per interval, or 31.25/50/62.5/71.43 ( 102.08/106.67/109.72/111.9) damage per second.
Therefore, the final damage dealt (before reductions) is 75/150/225/300 ( 245/320/395/470).
TALENT
The damage increasing  talent immediately updates the currently running instance.
With the duration increasing  talent, it deals a total of 106.25/200/287.5/371.43 damage.
With both  talents, it deals a total of 347.08/426.67/504.72/581.9 damage.
The heal is calculated in the same way as the damage and is applied after each damage instance.
Always heals for the full amount per interval, regardless of how much damage the target actually takes.
SHARD Shackles now places a total of 4  Serpent Wards based on its current level, 100 range towards the target's north, east, south, and west.
The wards summoned has a fixed 6-second duration, and it is not based on the total channel time.
The wards' facing angle is set equal to Shadow Shaman's facing angle upon cast.
The wards are ordered to attack the target upon creation, but they can be controlled by the player following Mass Serpent Wards' notes.
All of Serpent Wards'  talents and  Aghanim's Scepter upgrade notes are fully applied as well.
Serpent Wards are not summoned in the following conditions:
If  Mass Serpent Ward is not learned.
If the first damage instance kills the affected target.

Causes Serpent Wards to have split shot, attacking two units for full damage.

Modifiers [?]modifier_shadow_shaman_serpent_wardDeath
Snake charming was a big part of the Shadow Shaman's act; now Rhasta can empower the Snakes to do his bidding.


Places a  Serpent Ward on every 36°th of a 150 radius circle, resulting in 10 wards forming a ring.
The wards form a perfect barrier, enemies inside cannot move out unless they have phased movement.
Destroying one ward is enough to allow units to walk in and out of the ring.
The wards' facing angle is set equal to Shadow Shaman's facing angle upon cast.
Serpent Wards can be controlled to attack a specific target or to stop attacking altogether.
Serpent Wards have a lower target priority than other units and heroes, so they are attacked by towers and creeps last.
 Roshan always prioritizes wards if there are no other units within his attack range.  Strength of the Immortal also instantly destroy Serpent Wards.
Treat attacks from towers as heroes, and creep-heroes as creeps.
The wards' attack damage is not reduced by damage block.
SCEPTER The wards now perform instant attacks on 1 different enemy target within their attack range whenever they launch an attack projectile.
An extra projectile is released at the same time together with the primary attack.
Therefore, it does not matter whether the primary attack misses or not, the extra projectile is still released.
The extra projectile travels at the same speed as the primary projectile and can be disjointed like regular attacks.
These instant attacks neither proc any attack modifiers nor on-hit effects normally.
They do not have True Strike and are affected by evasion.
The extra attack does not target wards, invisible units, untargetable units, or units inside the Fog of War, but they do target buildings.
The extra attack has no target priorities. It simply chooses a random valid target within its attack range.
Acquiring  Aghanim's Scepter instantly upgrades all current existing  Serpent Wards.

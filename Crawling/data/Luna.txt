Lucent Beam first applies the damage, then the debuff.
Luna's glaive emits particles during the cast time, visible to everyone.
Provides 200 radius ground vision around the affected target for 3 seconds.
TALENT The Glaives fired on Lucent Beam  talent launches 2 instant attacks on random enemies, closest from the target's location, within 500 search radius of the target upon cast, excluding  Eclipse's beams.
Does not launch additional instant attacks on the same unit per cast when there is only a single target.
Despite the description, it neither launches Moon Glaives upon cast nor relies on Moon Glaves to be leveled to launch the instant attacks.
The instant attacks originate from the targeted point or unit, they can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally (including  Moon Glaives). They do not have True Strike, but ignore disarms.
The attacks do not target invisible units but can target units in Fog of War.
For  melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss. Moon Glaives   Link▶️WG

Aghanim's Shard Upgrade:

Moon Glaives can be activated to create 4 glaives that rotate in a 175 radius around Luna for 7 seconds, reducing damage she takes by 25%. Any unit that collides with a glaive will take 75% of Luna's Attack Damage.

Ability Disjoint Notes:Does not bounce when disjointed by the primary attack target.When disjointed by a secondary target, the disjointing unit is not registered as hit, the attack may immediately bounce on it again if its within range. The disjointed instance still counts towards the bounce limit.Modifiers [?]modifier_luna_moon_glaiveUndispellable

Carefully sharpened, Luna's boomerang-like weapon cuts a wide swath through enemy numbers.


If the leading attack misses, Moon Glaives do not bounce.
The bouncing glaives travel at the same speed as the leading attack's projectile and can be further increased by attack projectile speed bonuses.
With Luna's default attack projectile speed, the bouncing projectiles travel at a speed of 900.
Despite its identical appearance to Luna's normal attack, the bouncing projectile deals physical spell damage. They are not instant attacks.
These projectiles also neither trigger any attack modifier nor on-hit effects. Evasion has no effect on them.
Does bounce to but does not damage ethereal units.
The spell damage value is based on the attack damage value calculated for the leading attack during its attack point.
It has the following flags:
No-spell-lifesteal flag, preventing its damage from utilizing spell lifesteal.
No-spell-amplification flag, preventing its damage from being amplified with spell damage amplification.
Not affected by the actual damage taken (after reductions) by the target.
Not affected by other conditional attack damage bonuses (e.g.  Pierce) as well.
However, the damage value fully works with critical strike and quell sources, since these are included in the initial attack damage calculation.
The projectiles' damage is still affected by damage block sources and  Bulwark, but not  Resonant Pulse.
Effectively increases Luna's outgoing damage by 87.5%/111.04%/138.34%/171.71% ( 111.15%/143.45%/181.6%/229.45%) if all 3/4/5/6 bounces hit.
For how much damage each Moon Glaives bounce deals (before reductions) to the affected target(s), please refer to the chart below.
Can bounce back to the same units if it already hit all other nearby units.
Cannot bounce to invisible units and units in the Fog of War.
Can bounce to untargetable units from  Book of Shadows and  Shadow Realm.
Does not bounce to wards,  Couriers and allies, but it does bounce off of them when attacking them.
Fully works against buildings.
Upon learning, Luna's glaive permanently emits blue particles, visible to everyone.
For  melee attacks, Moon Glaives uses a projectile after the primary attack.
SHARD Adds an active component to Moon Glaives, with the passive effects still present.
Upon cast, 4 glaives spawn from the center of Luna, logarithmically spiraling out in 1.2 seconds until reaching the orbit of revolution.
The glaives deal damage upon cast, then orbits in a 175 radius centered around Luna at a speed of 160, and are centered on Luna for the full duration.
The glaives are phased and are invulnerable units that self-rotates in 0.133 seconds per revolution.
The glaives can be seen even when Luna is invisible or in the Fog of War.
Luna performs instant attacks on hit enemies within 115 radius of the orbiting glaives.
Although the glaives are performing the instant attacks, the damage is sourced to Luna.
These instant attacks neither proc any attack modifiers, nor on-hit effects. They have True Strike, but completely ignore disarms.
For  melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss.
Successive casts refresh its active duration, but do not respawn the active glaives.
The instant attacks' damage can be defined as expr ΣAtk × 75%
The active glaives neither collides with invulnerable nor hidden units.
Fully affect enemy  Couriers.
SHARD Applies generic incoming damage reduction on Luna while active. Stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation.
Reduces all damage types Luna receives, except from damage flagged as HP removal (e.g.  Heartstopper Aura).
The sound effects of the active glaives while damaging enemies are audible for Luna, including damaging invisible enemy units and damaging units through the Fog of War. Lunar Blessing  EL

Showers random nearby enemies with strikes from Luna's current level of Lucent Beam. These beams do not stun their targets, and there is a maximum number of times that a single target can be struck. Also turns day into night for 10 seconds.

Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
Allows Luna to cast Eclipse on an allied unit or herself and have its effects follow them, or cast it on an area. Also increases total beams and duration, removes the limit on beams per unit, and makes the beams appear twice as fast.

Spell Block / Reflection Notes:Eclipse's beams are not blocked upon hit.Modifiers [?]modifier_luna_eclipseDeath

modifier_stunnedStrongIn times of great need, Selemene herself descends into the world, blocking out the light and hope of the opposed.


Eclipse turns the Time of Day into  nighttime for 10 seconds. This is independent of Eclipse's duration.
Time of Day modifying abilities has the following priorities:  Supernova ➤ Eclipse ➤  Dark Ascension.
However, it does not interfere with the  nighttime caused by Dark Ascension in any way — they do not cancel or pause each other's nighttime.
Eclipse's beams deal damage based on the current level of  Lucent Beam.
If it is not leveled, or if the caster does not have Lucent Beam, Eclipse deals no damage. Eclipse notes fully apply.
The maximum possible damage to a single target (before reductions) on each level of Lucent Beam is:
LEVEL 1 375 ( 875) ( 450/900/1350,  1050/2100/3150)
LEVEL 2 750 ( 1250) ( 900/1800/2700,  1500/3000/4500)
LEVEL 3 1125 ( 1625) ( 1350/2700/4050,  1950/3900/5850)
LEVEL 4 1500 ( 2000) ( 1800/3600/5400,  2400/4800/7200)

Does not hit invisible units and units in the Fog of War.
Successive casts of Eclipse work independently of each other.
When Luna dies, Eclipse ends prematurely. However, the  nighttime it created persists.
Luna's glaive emits particles during the cast time, visible to everyone.
SCEPTER Adds area-targeting functionality to Eclipse. It may be unit-targeted on an ally or ground-targeted.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
When targeting an ally, it follows that ally like how a regular cast follows Luna.
Can target any allied units, including  Couriers, except for wards and buildings.
Eclipse ends when the targeted ally dies, instead of Luna.
When ground-targeted, it stays stationary at the targeted point.
Provides 675 radius ground vision for its duration.
Eclipse still ends prematurely when Luna dies.
TALENT The Eclipse mini-stun  talent causes the beams to stun enemies for 0.25 seconds.
Can stun up to a maximum of 1.25 ( 1.5/3/4.5) seconds on a single target on each Eclipse level.
The stun duration is not based on Lucent Beam's stun and is applied regardless of Lucent Beam's ability level.
Eclipse's beams first apply their damage, then the debuff.
Learning this  talent immediately updates all currently active Eclipse instances.
SPELL STEAL  Lucent Beams applied is based on  Luna's current ability level when acquired.

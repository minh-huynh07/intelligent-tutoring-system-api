The targeting reticule must be centered over an enemy unit.
Deals the area damage onto the primary target as well for a total of 120/200/280/360 ( 245/325/405/485) damage (before reductions).
The damage is not summed up into a single instance, meaning the primary target takes two damage instances.
Frost Blast first applies the area damage, the debuff, then the base damage.

modifier_lich_frost_shield_slowAnyFirst conceived of to protect him in his mortal years, the frost magic that Ethreain weaves around himself has only grown colder with time.

Heals  Ice Spire for 1 hero hit (or 2 of the unit's health) per pulse.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
Applies generic incoming damage reduction on the affected target. Stacks additively with other sources of generic incoming damage manipulation.
Affects only hero-based attack damage, including instant attack sources, regardless of damage type, the affected target recieves.

Does not reduce the following damage sources:
Spell damage.
Damage flagged as HP removal.
All Cleave sources.
Pulses in 1-second intervals, starting 0.1 seconds after cast, resulting in 5/6/7/8 ( 9/10/11/12) pulses.

The pulses first apply their damage, then the movement speed slow debuff.
Frost Shield does not hit invisible units or units in the Fog of War.
Successive casts on the same target do not stack but refresh the duration, and reset the pulse interval.
Both leveling up Frost Shield and the health regeneration  talent do not update the current active instance.
SCEPTER While channeling   Sinister Gaze, Frost Shield has an  instant cast time, does not require facing the target to cast and can be cast on untargetable allies.
TALENT The health regeneration  talent fully works for ward-type units and buildings as well, except for Ice Spires.

However, it does not update the currently active instance of Frost Shield.

Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
Sinister Gaze becomes an Area of Effect ability, affecting units within a radius of 400 in the target area. Sinister Gaze allows Lich to cast other abilities while channeling it.

modifier_lich_sinister_gazeAnyAbility Draft Notes:
Allows casting any non-channeled abilities and items during  Sinister Gaze without interrupting it.
Mind the cold...


Applies a hypnotizing fear and provides True Sight over the target, forcing it to face and move towards the Lich, and preventing it from acting.
Does not provide any form of other visions over the target(s).
Certain status effects on the affected target that might cancel other channeling abilities do not cancel Sinister Gaze. This includes the following status effects:
The target turning invisible, invulnerable or hidden.
The target being affected by the Fog of War.
The target being dispelled in any way.
In short, Sinister Gaze can only be canceled if Lich's channeling is interrupted.
Applies the following effects on the affected target(s) while Sinister Gaze is channeling:
Grants the affected target unobstructed movement and does not destroy trees while moving.
Unlocks the target's minimum and maximum movement speed limits, then sets the target's movement speed to 32%/38%/44%/50% of the distance between Lich and the target.
The set movement speed does not adapt even if target is moved or teleported.
When cast at max cast range, this results in a speed of 174.55 ( 128).
Drains 12% of target's current mana in 0.1-second intervals, resulting in 11/14/17/20 ( 15/18/21/24) instances.
Can drain up to ≈12.44%/15.55%/18.55%/21.45% ( 13.99%/16.55%/19.03%/21.43%) of the target(s)' current mana.
The mana gained is based on how much the target actually lose on each interval, enemy targets with higher current mana will restore more mana than using the ability on a target with lesser current mana. If they have no mana left, no mana is gained either.
However, if Lich is at full mana, the target still continues to lose mana.
Deals 25 damage to creeps based on the same intervals, starting immediately upon cast, resulting in 22/28/34/40 ( 30/36/42/48) instances.
Can deal up to 550/700/850/1000 ( 750/900/1050/1200) damage to creeps (before reductions).
Treats illusions, creep-heroes and ancient creeps as heroes.
Destroys trees within a 200 radius around the target at the end of the channeling.
All aspects of Sinister Gaze are not affected by status resistance sources.
SCEPTER Sinister Gaze now turns into an area-targeted ability, so that it cannot directly target units anymore.
Fully affects untargetable, invisible units and units under Fog of War.
The  Ability Upgrade now allows Lich to cast his other abilities (e.g.  Frost Blast,  Frost Shield,  Ice Spire and  Chain Frost) while channeling Sinister Gaze without interrupting it, as long as the target is within cast range.
This means during Sinister Gaze, all of Lich's abilities have an  instant cast time and do not require facing the target to cast.
Does not apply to item abilities.
SPELL STEAL / MORPH NOTES  Sinister Gaze's ability upgrade is only limited to  Lich's basic abilities. Ice Spire   Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️DE

 Frost Shield applies all its ability effects and heals the Ice Spire for 2 health.
Always heals for the full amount per instance, regardless of how much damage the targets actually take.
Treats attacks from clones as heroes, and attacks from creep-heroes and illusions as creeps.
 Chain Frost can bounce on, and be directly targeted on  Ice Spires.
It may only bounce to the spire if no other valid targets are within its bounce distance.
The bounces still fully count toward the bounce limit.
Can only bounce on ally Ice Spires, enemy spires are ignored.
If multiple spires are within range, it chooses one at random.
Can bounce back and forth between multiple spires if no enemies are within range.
Ice Spire gains its spell immunity through a buff, so it is possible for enemies to check the buff and ‼ Ping the remaining duration of the ward.

The projectile bounces with a 0.2-second delay.
The projectile stops providing vision and stops playing a sound upon hitting non-hero units when bouncing more than 60 times.

For  Undying Zombies and  Couriers, Chain Frost can be cast on them, but not bounce on them.
Does not bounce on hidden and invisible units, and already invulnerable units.
However, it can bounce on untargetable units from  Shadows and  Shadow Realm.
Chain Frost fully affects  Roshan only when the first instance is cast on him.
Otherwise, the projectile can bounce on, but neither damages nor applies its debuff.

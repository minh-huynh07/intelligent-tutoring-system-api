The pain of deception comes not while it happens, but when it is revealed.

     Disruption illusion as they appear to allies.  
Disruption fully disables the target and turns it invulnerable and hidden for its duration.
Does not disjoint projectiles.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
Cannot be cast on allies who have ☐ Disabled Help from Shadow Demon.
The following abilities fully affect the target under the effect of the most recent Disruption cast by Shadow Demon, regardless of its source:
 Shadow Poison adding new stack or increasing its stacks.
Casting  Shadow Poison Release or losing the Shadow Poison debuff in any way still causes the damage to be dealt.
 Demonic Purge and  Demonic Cleanse's damage and heal respectively.
Always creates the illusions, even when cast on allies or self.
Can be cast on illusions, creating illusions based on the original hero.
Does not create illusions if the affected target dies while affected by Disruption.
When the target turns invisible during Disruption, the visual effects turn invisible as well.
The illusions are created at the end of the duration. When the target dies during Disruption, no illusions are created.
The current health of the illusions is determined upon casting Disruption, not upon creating the illusions at the end of the duration.
This means any health loss caused by Shadow Demon's abilities during Disruption does not affect the health of the illusions that are about to spawn.
All other stats like hero level or current mana are determined upon creating the illusions.
The illusions have a expr 2 × IllusionLVL bounty.
The targeted unit's position is not shuffled with the possible illusion's position. It always reappears between the 2 illusions, at the right vertex of an isosceles right triangle.
The illusion spawns 108-distance from the affected enemy hero if the target's collision size is 27, and 72-distance if its collision size is 18.
Each illusion appears either north, east, south, or west from the hero and faces the same direction as the affected hero does.
The illusions carry the caster's name, not the targeted unit's player name, revealing that they are illusions when not cast on self.

Whenever the target takes damage, all enemies, including the target itself if it is an enemy, within 675 range of the target also receive a portion of that damage. Can target enemy and allied units. Effect is paused if the target is hidden by Disruption.

Disseminate has no damage delay, so all targets within the radius are damaged at the same time.
Can be cast on any units, except wards and hidden units.
Can only be cast on ally  Couriers.
↓↓ Double-tapping automatically targets self.
The shared damage is always sourced to Shadow Demon.
Therefore, if a unit dies to the damage done by Disseminate, Shadow Demon gets credited for the kill.
Disseminate spreads damage before all damage manipulations within the radius before the affected target actually receives the damage. The primary target is also affected by the spreading damage.
Effectively amplifies all damage done to the primary target by 20%/25%/30%/35% ( 35%/40%/45%/50%).
The damage received by the affected target can be affected by the following sources:
 Incoming damage manipulation the affected target has.
 Outgoing damage manipulation sourced to Shadow Demon.
Since it can be affected by incoming damage manipulation sources of the affected target, Disseminate shares the overkill damage value, if the damage source exceeds the affected target's current health and killed them.
Damage shared is the same type as the source damage.
Damage shared has the HP Removal flag, therefore do not interact with every on-damage effects (i.e. disabling  Blink Dagger).
Shares all damage types except HP Removal.
Shared physical damage is still affected by magic resistance. However, shared physical damage is not affected by the damage block.
Instant kill effects in the form of HP Removal (e.g.  Culling Blade) share an instance of 0 damage within its radius.
Fully procs on-damage effects such as  Corrosive Skin, except those which have a minimum damage threshold (e.g.  Gravekeeper's Cloak).
Disseminate's damage has the no-reflection flag, preventing its damage from interacting with other sources of damage with the same flag.
Non-player-controlled units are not aggro'd by the damage.
Neutral creeps do not react to the damage.
Successive casts update the ability values and refresh its duration.
Despite the ability's description,  Disruption neither pauses the duration nor dispel Disseminate.
The Disseminate buff or debuff is reapplied based on the remaining Disseminate duration once Disruption ends based on whether either ability is applied as a buff or debuff. This affects the following things:
If both   abilities are applied as a buff (or debuff) on the affected target, the reapplied duration will result as a buff (or debuff respectively), regardless of the remaining Disseminate duration.
If the   abilities are applied as a buff and the other as a debuff on the affected target, the buff type of the resulting reapplied remaining duration depends on the difference of the remaining duration.
For other situations with Disruption and Disseminate applying either a buff or debuff, please refer to the chart below. Shadow Poison Link▶️Link▶️Link▶️EW

Deals damage in a line, and afflicts enemy units with a poison effect. The poison deals 1/2/4/8/16 times the stack damage based on the number of stacks on the target, up to 5 stacks. Additional stacks cause 50 damage each. This deferred damage is dealt when Shadow Poison's duration is expired, or the Release sub-ability is used.

This ability has Autocast toggled on if enemies are debuffed by Shadow Poison.When toggled off, the poison is released, triggering the damage.
The ever growing influence of the Shadow Demon can pollute the most valiant and pure of heroes.


Shadow Poison travels at a speed of 1200 and always travels the full distance, which takes 1.25 seconds.
The projectile provides 350 radius non-lingering flying vision around the poison cloud as it travels.
Provides 300 radius flying vision around each enemy unit it hits, and also upon reaching the maximum travel distance. This vision lingers for 3.5 seconds.
With the travel distance and effect radius, it can hit units up to 1700 range away.
Fully affects invisible units and units under the effect of the most recent  Disruption cast by Shadow Demon.
Does not affect invulnerable units or units affected other hidden sources.
Shadow Poison first applies the initial damage, then adds 1 stack to all enemy units within 200 radius of it on each cast.
The poison first applies the debuff or adds 1 stack to an existing debuff, then deals the initial damage.
Successive hits on the same unit fully refresh the whole stack's duration.
The first 5 stacks get their damage multiplied by 1/2/4/8/16 depending on the amount of stacks.
Every following stack adds 50 ( 57.5) damage on top of that, so the damage starts growing linearly after the 5th stack.
Therefore, the poison's max potency is reached at the 5th stack.
The damage difference between applying 2 separate stacks of five and 1 stack of ten (excluding the initial damage) is 134/326/518/710 ( 154.1/374.9/595.7/816.5).
For how much damage each stack of Shadow Poison deals on each level up to the 10th stack, with the damage increasing  talent (before reductions), please refer to the chart below.
Casting  Shadow Poison Release or losing the Shadow Poison debuff in any way causes the damage to be dealt.
From the same source, successive casts update the ability values and refresh the whole stack's duration.
From different sources, successive casts increase the stack count of the first applied stack. The damage values are not updated, and therefore the stack damage value is based on the first applied stack.
The current number of stacks is visible to Shadow Demon and his allies above the affected units. Enemies cannot see it.
This number is visually capped at 19, however, the poison has no stack limit and can be stacked infinitely.
The current number of stacks is also shown on the debuff icon, which is visible to everyone.
SPELL STEAL / MORPH NOTES Successive casts of different ability levels increase the stack count of the first applied stack. However, the damage values are not updated, the stack damage value is based on the first applied stack. Shadow Poison Release DE

Releases a wave of energetic plasma that grows in power as it expands, but also zaps on contraction, slowing and dealing damage to enemy units caught in its path. Damage and slow increases with distance from Razor. The Plasma Field hits each unit twice, once each direction.

Interrupts Razor's channeling abilities upon cast.
Plasma Field expands and retracts at a speed of 636, taking a total of 2.2 seconds to fully expand and retract.
Plasma Field is centered on Razor for the full duration.
Provides 700 radius flying vision during the 4.4-second effect, following Razor and leaving a trail of vision which lasts 2 seconds.
The effect area is a 100 range wide annulus, a ring shape.
The ring starts 105 range away from Razor and expands for up to 700 range, reaching a total distance of 805.
Together with the damage width, it can hit units up to 905 range away.
The visual effect starts at Razor's location and expands for the same distance.
This means the visual effect is 105 range behind the damaging ring, and not centered on it.
The damage and movement speed slow are applied upon expanding and upon retracting, so each enemy can be hit twice.
However, enemies can only be affected once upon expanding and once upon retracting. Although the slow debuff fully stacks, their durations are independent of each other.
With the radius, expanding and retracting speed, enemies within 477 range of Razor can be slowed for the max duration of 3 seconds.
It can be avoided by teleporting (e.g.  Return) towards the expanding or retracting side over the ring after being affected.
Does not affect invisible units.
Can deal up to 70/80/90/100 ‒ 160/230/300/370 ( 130/140/150/160 ‒ 220/290/360/430) damage (before reductions) and slow for up to 10% ‒ 50%/60%/70%/80% movement speed.
Plasma Field first applies the damage, then the debuff.
The damage and movement speed slow values are based on how far the ring traveled, reaching max values at 805 range.
105 Distance: 35/40/45/50 ( 65/70/75/80) damage and 5%/5%/5%/5% slow.
205 Distance: 41/51/60/69 ( 71/81/90/99) damage and 8%/9%/9%/10% slow.
305 Distance: 48/61/75/89 ( 78/91/105/119) damage and 11%/12%/14%/15% slow.
405 Distance: 54/72/90/108 ( 84/102/120/138) damage and 14%/16%/18%/20% slow.
505 Distance: 61/83/105/127 ( 91/113/135/157) damage and 16%/19%/22%/25% slow.
605 Distance: 67/94/120/146 ( 97/124/150/176) damage and 19%/23%/26%/30% slow.
705 Distance: 74/104/135/166 ( 104/134/165/196) damage and 22%/26%/31%/35% slow.
805 Distance: 80/115/150/185 ( 110/145/180/215) damage and 25%/30%/35%/40% slow.
905 Distance: 80/115/150/185 ( 110/145/180/215) damage and 25%/30%/35%/40% slow.

TALENT Releases a secondary Plasma Field instance 0.8-seconds upon cast and once per Plasma Field cast.
The secondary cast works while on cooldown, does not cost mana, and works while Razor is disabled.
The secondary instance can deal up to 49/56/63/70 ‒ 112/161/210/259.
Other Plasma Field notes fully apply.
With the damage increasing  talent, it can deal up to 91/98/105/112 ‒ 154/203/252/301 damage. Static Link  Link▶️WC

Alt-Cast Icon
Static Link is broken when either unit dies or the link gets stretched more than 800 range. Nothing else can break the link.
The distance between Razor and the target is checked right before each damage steal interval. If the distance is greater upon the check, the link breaks.
Since the link uses the ability's cast range, cast range increasing effects increase the link break distance and the move while attacking distance as well.
Provides shared vision over the target while draining.
Grants regular flat bonus attack damage to Razor while reducing the affected target's total attack damage.
Static Link keeps stealing damage even if the target's damage has reached 0.
Static Link can drain up to 50/100/150/200 ( 100/150/200/250) damage and attack speed as well as 10 armor when draining for the full duration.
Static Link orders Razor to attack the target upon cast, and upon each move order.
Allows Razor to move while attacking the Static Link target.
Razor still is facing the Static Link target while attacking, despite sometimes the attack animation showing otherwise.
To not attack the target while moving, a unit-targeted order or a ground-targeted order that is not a move or attack order must be given to Razor.
If auto-attack is set to ◎ Never, the stop (S) and hold (H) commands also stop Razor from attacking the target.
 Eye of the Storm prioritizes enemies that have the Static Link vision modifier on them, striking them over any other unit when within range, regardless of health values.
Can be cast on heroes, illusions and creep-heroes.
Fully affects already linked targets even when they turn invulnerable and hidden.
For  melee units, if the enemy target is 350 range farther than the attacker's range, the attack will always miss.
Static Link cannot be successively cast on units that already have attack damage drained.
This means it is impossible for one enemy to have multiple separate attack damage debuffs, except when interacting with  Soulbind.
However, it is possible to drain attack damage from multiple separate targets at the same time. The attack damage buff on Razor fully stacks.
When targeting multiple enemies, only the first targeted enemy may be attacked while moving.
SHARD Upon acquiring the  Ability Upgrade, it has Alt-cast activated by default.
Upon cast with Alt-Cast activated, Static Link pulls both Razor and the linked target toward each other while the link is active.
The Alt-Cast also acts as a toggle while active, whenever it is toggled on/off, the pulling starts/stops immediately.
SHARD The following effects are applied on both Razor and the affected target:
Upon the target reaching the 175 min distance, they are no longer pulled toward each other unless the distance becomes more than 175 again.
Static Link pulls them until they reach the minimum distance even when they are invulnerable or hidden.
Affects the  Tree Dance unit, but does not unperch it.
Successive casts while a previous cast is still active do not affect already pulled enemies.
Does not pull them over impassable terrain.
Does not pull them when they are affected by other disabling forced movement sources.
Does not impede them at all and they can still turn, attack, and cast abilities.
Can move the affected target for 1000 distance for the entire duration.
Acquiring  Aghanim's Shard does not update the current active instance.
SOULBIND If any of the targets die, or when any of the links are broken, Razor attacks the currently linked target. Can be cast multiple times on the primary target, but not on the secondary target. The link does not break upon  Soulbind's leash debuff expiring. Storm Surge   Link▶️EN



AbilityPassive
AffectsSelf  / Enemies
DamageMagical

Passively increases Razor's movement speed. There's a chance when attacked, and always when targeted with a spell, to release a forked lightning that strikes the target and other nearby enemies, prioritizing the unit type of the attacker, dealing damage and slowing movement speed.

Procs Globally on valid enemy targets in the following conditions:
Whenever a unit, including wards, lands an attack on Razor, following Storm Surge's debuff immunity notes.
On allied attacks. Doing so applies only the movement speed slow on the proccing ally, but it still chooses enemies as secondary targets.
Triggers Globally on every unit-targeted ability cast on Razor, including ground-targeted abilities with unit-targeting option.
It neither follows the Spell Reflection list, nor the Spell Block list. Projectile-based abilities trigger it on launch, not on impact.
The debuff is applied after the triggering ability takes effect.
This means if the casting unit dies to the Forked Lightning's damage, the triggering ability still takes effect.
Does not proc on the following conditions:
Attacks from buildings.
On missed attacks.
The search radius is centered around the primary target (i.e. the triggering unit), and not around Razor.
If the primary target is or turns debuff immune, invulnerable or hidden, the forked lightning searches for 2 secondary targets in this case.
The primary target can still be affected by Forked Lightning while invisible or untargetable.
The secondary targets are chosen randomly within 700 radius centered around the primary target, there are no priorities.
If triggered by an attack, it does not target invisible and untargetable units or units inside the Fog of War as secondary targets.
If triggered by ability, it does target invisible units or units inside the Fog of War.
Storm Surge first applies the damage, then the debuff.
Storm Surge proc chance uses pseudo-random distribution.
Procs do not use a regular cooldown. It is neither displayed on the ability icon when proccing nor affected by cooldown manipulating effects. Eye of the Storm Link▶️Link▶️RE

Modifiers [?]modifier_razor_eye_of_the_stormDeath

modifier_razor_eye_of_the_storm_armorDeathRide the lightning.


Interrupts Razor's channeling abilities upon cast.
Eye of the Storm has the following priorities:
The storm prioritizes enemies that have the  Static Link vision modifier on them, striking them over any other unit when within range, regardless of health values.
Then the lowest current health within the radius.
If there are multiple units with the same lowest health in range, Eye of the Storm chooses between them randomly.
When there are multiple enemies with the vision modifier within the radius, the storm chooses between them randomly on each strike.
The strikes are neither regular attacks nor instant attacks, so they fully ignore effects such as evasion and damage block sources.
This also means that they cannot trigger on-attack effects (i.e.  Counter Helix or break enemy's  Tranquil Boots).
However, it is considered as spell damage, it is affected by spell damage amplification and works with spell lifesteal.
The strikes first apply the armor reduction, then the damage.
The armor reduction debuff on units lasts as long as the storm, or until Razor dies.
Successive casts create multiple Eye of the Storms, their strike damage fully stacks and the strike intervals are independent of each other.
Eye of the Storm immediately ends when Razor dies.
Does not affect wards,  Couriers,  Roshan, invisible units and units in the Fog of War.
Eye of the Storm can strike up to 42/50/60 ( 50/60/75) times and deal up to 2520/3750/5400 ( 3000/4500/6750) damage per target (before reductions).
When Razor turns invisible, Eye of the Storm and its strike turn invisible as well but still strike nearby enemies without them seeing or hearing them.
SCEPTER The strike now damages buildings, but does not reduce their armor.
Prioritizes units over buildings and fully ignores filler buildings.
It also allows it to strike 2 targets at the same time on each interval.
An enemy may only be hit by one strike at a time, so a lone target is not hit multiple times per instance.

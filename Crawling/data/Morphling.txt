Fully affects invisible enemy units and units in the Fog of War.
Does not travel the full distance, when targeting closer than the max distance.
TALENT
The Waveform attack targets  talent causes Morphling to perform instant attacks on every enemy hit by Waveform.
These instant attacks can proc any attack modifiers and on-hit effects normally. They do not have True Strike, but completely ignore disarms.
Waveform first deals its damage, then applies the instant attacks.
Does not affect  Couriers.

Does not interrupt Morphling's channeling abilities upon toggling.
Costs 25/100/225/400 mana per shift interval, resulting in 5/10/15/20 mana per second.
The mana cost per second is fixed and it is not affected by mana loss manipulation.

Can only convert Morphling's base agility and strength. Bonus attributes are not converted.
Shifted attributes are permanent and not reverted on death.
Attribute Shift continues to convert attributes even if Morphling is disabled, but cannot be toggled On / Off while disabled.
SHARD This restriction is removed upon acquring  Aghanim's Shard, allowing Morphling to toggle Attribute Shift even while disabled. However, Morphling is now unable to ⇧ Shift-queue this ability.
It can be toggled while stunned, cycloned, slept, taunted, hidden, or during forced movement, but not while silenced, hexed or prevented from acting.
Toggling one Attribute Shift ability On automatically toggles the other Off.
If Attribute Shift cannot convert anymore due to a lack of attribute points or mana, the toggle status remains the same, but the process is paused until it can continue. Attribute Shift (Strength Gain)  Link▶️FF

The strength bonus/loss counts as setting health, it does not keep the current health percentage but instead adds/removes 22 health per strength to/from the current health pool.
Health freeze sources keep the current health value the same, but do not stop the max health from increasing.
However, for other health-based amplifications and reductions, only the part that exceeds the current health percentage is affected. This affects the following things:
 Morphling's current health percentage is now 30% at 300/1000 health.
It gained 22 bonus current and max health from attribute shifting. However, the new current/max health percentage values are not considered in the calculations.
30% of the 22 bonus health granted (6 health) will not be affected by health-based amplifications and reductions, while the remaining bonus health (15 health) is affected. Morph  Link▶️RR

Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
Adds an alt-cast to Morph. When enabled, a strong illusion is created of the target hero that can cast all of the hero's basic abilities. If the illusion is alive when Morphling toggles the ability, he will take the place of the illusion, destroying it.Upgrades abilities acquired via Morph to their Scepter version.

This ability is not available in Ability Draft.
Staring into Morphling produces a reflection that mimics the beholder.

Alt-Cast Icon
Neither replaces Morphling with a clone nor an illusion of the target. Morph only copies the target's model, hitbox, including equipped cosmetic items.
The combat log still registers the copied model as Morphling.
Morphling can still be killed normally in the Morphed form.
Morph neither acquires innate abilities nor other innate ability traits (e.g. freely moving in the  Chronosphere), except the following abilities:
 Stone Remnant,  Mana Shield and  Stone Form.
While active, Morphling is visually distinguishable from the original hero.
Neither dispels buff and debuffs upon cast and casting the  Morph Replicate sub-ability.
Keeps the current health and mana percentages upon cast. Morph does not copy the target's current health or mana.
The affected target's hero icon is displayed as a debuff on the HUD.
Changes Morphling's current base attribute values and primary attribute from  agility to the affected target's values.
Bonus attributes from abilities and items are not copied.
Changes Morphling's attack range type from  ranged to the affected target's attack range type.
This causes items that use different values for melee and ranged heroes (e.g.  Manta Style) to now adapt to Morphling accordingly.
Attack range-increasing sources are not overridden and still work normally.
Fully copies the target's movement speed.
This means when targeting a melee strength hero, Morphling becomes a  melee  strength hero for the duration.
All other base stats of the affected target (e.g. attack damage values, armor, magic resistance, base attack time, collision size, etc.) are not copied.
Does not copy the target's transformed state as well (e.g.  Elder Dragon Form).
Items are not copied as well.
Most channeling abilities are interrupted upon unmorphing, except for  Phase Shift,  Upheaval, and casting item abilities.
Treat clones and illusions as heroes, creep-heroes and the  Spirit Bear as creeps.
Casting on illusions is considered as casting Morph on the hero who owns the illusion.
Therefore, Morph copies the hero who owns the illusion and not the hero the illusion is based on. Casting ability on an illusion based on a dead hero does nothing.
For example, when targeting  Disruption illusions, Morphling turns into  Shadow Demon, and not the hero Disruption was cast on.
However, it cannot target Morphling itself or illusions under Morphling's control.
An  Enchanted Morphling illusion is still treated as its own illusion and can still not be targeted.
SCEPTER Upon acquiring the  Ability Upgrade, it has Alt-cast activated by default.
With Alt-Cast activated, Morph creates a strong illusion of the affected target that can cast all of the target's basic abilities, but not ultimate and item abilities.
The Morph Illusion spawns with full health and faces the same angle as the affected target.
The Morph Illusion neither has a gold nor an experience bounty.
The distance between the Morphling and the Morph illusion is always one-fourth of the distance between Morphling and the target.
SCEPTER The  Morphed Illusion acquire innate abilities and other innate ability traits.
However, it cannot acquire  Invoked and  Devoured abilities.
The ability cooldown of the acquired basic abilities is shared between Morphling and the Morph Illusion.
However, it does not share the charges of Charge-based Abilities. Therefore, Morphling and the Morph Illusion both have independent charges for charged-based abilities.
When losing the  Ability Upgrade, the Morph Illusion is not instantly killed, and the  Morph Replicate sub-ability can still teleport Morphling to its place.
However, casting Morph no longer shifts Morphling back into the affected target.
SPELL STEAL This ability is not acquirable.  Spell Steal cannot acquire any abilities from the  Morphed Illusion.

Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade:
If the illusion is alive when Morphling toggles the ability, he will take the place of the illusion, destroying it.




Morph Replicate replaces  Morph until it expires.
The Legacy Keys for Morph Replicate is the same as the target's ultimate ability's Legacy Keys.
Interrupts Morphling's channeling abilities upon cast.
Casting this does not end Morph. Instead, it shifts Morphling back to his original form. When used again, it shifts Morphling back into the target.
Goes on cooldown whenever forms get shifted.
SCEPTER Casting the sub-ability while the  Morphed Illusion is alive first shifts Morphling into the target, then teleports Morphling to the current position of the illusion and instantly kills it in the form of HP Removal.
The damage dealt can be defined as expr 100% × CurrentHP
Does not disjoint projectiles upon teleporting.
Upon each  Morph and  Morph Replicate cast, it checks for Morphling and the affected target's basic abilities, then it removes Morphling's abilities and replaces them with the affected target's basic abilities, including their passive abilities and sub-abilities.
Therefore, Morphling has to cast Morph Replicate twice to update all copied abilities and their values.
This affects the following things:
 Invoked abilities.
New basic abilities acquired via  Spell Steal upon morphing into them.
New  Devoured abilities.
Non-ultimate abilities granted by  Aghanim's Scepter and  Aghanim's Shard are only copied if both Morphling and the affected target have the respective item as well. Does not copy  talent upgrades at all.
SCEPTER When losing the  Ability Upgrade, the Morph Illusion is not instantly killed, and the  Morph Replicate sub-ability can still teleport Morphling to its place.
However, casting Morph no longer shifts Morphling back into the affected target.

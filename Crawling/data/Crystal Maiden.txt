Also provides 0.1-second  1800 and  800 ground vision respectively upon cast.
Crystal Maiden slides backward from the direction she is facing, at a speed of 916.67 up to 0.3 seconds.
Can move over other units and over impassable terrain.
While sliding, Crystal Clone cancels all movement orders and attack orders, and then it creates an illusion instantly despite having a slight animation delay.
The illusion created does not visually animate, it is also unselectable and uncontrollable.
However, it can still be attacked by enemies via ground-targeting an attack (A) on the nearest unit.
Despite the ability tooltip, the illusion does not have a fixed health, it passively shatters when it collectively receives 150 damage (before all reductions, except Damage Barriers).
When the illusion shatters, it applies  Frostbite within 450 radius based on its current level.
Frostbite notes fully apply. If it is not learned, it is not applied.
The Frostbite applied is independent of the ability and does not cost any mana.
Taunt sources and its mechanic notes fully apply to the illusion.
However, once the illusion is taunted, the taunt state lasts indefinitely regardless of the taunt duration and does not change targets even when it cannot find the taunting unit anymore. Freezing Field  Link▶️RF

modifier_crystal_maiden_freezing_field_trackerDeathAbility Draft Notes:
 Frostbite must be drafted as well for it to get applied.
Once the place of her exile, Icewrack has become an anchor for Rylai's frigid onslaught.


Both the movement speed and attack speed slow is applied to all enemies within the radius in 0.1-second intervals, regardless of the ice explosions.
The explosions occur in 0.1 ( 0.083)-second intervals, starting 0.1 ( 0.083) seconds after cast, resulting in 99 ( 121) explosions.
Each ice explosion can spawn within a random distance of 195 to 785 away from Crystal Maiden.
The explosion spawn radius is divided into four 90° segments (0°–90°, 90°–180°, 180°–270°, 270°–360°).
The first explosion occurs within the northeast segment of the circle, following explosions proceeding counterclockwise, regardless of facing direction.
With the max spawn radius and explosion radius, it can damage units up to 1105 range away.
The radius is always centered on Crystal Maiden and follows her even when she is moved.
Despite the visual effects, the damage is dealt as the falling ice shards are spawned, not upon them reaching the ground.
SCEPTER Freezing Field now provides an aura that tracks enemies within the area. The tracker lingers for 0.1 seconds.
If an enemy unit is affected by the tracker for 2.5 seconds,  Frostbite is applied to the enemy unit based on its current level.
A unit can only be affected by Frostbite once per cast of Freezing Field. Even if they re-enter the area, they are not affected a second time.
If a unit is already frostbitten by a manual cast, it can still be frostbitten again by Freezing Field, and refreshing the duration.
The tracker resets whenever it is reapplied to a unit. This means a unit must be affected by it for 2.5 seconds continuously in order to be frostbitten.
The tracker is placed on enemies even without having  Aghanim's Scepter, tracking the duration enemies spend within the area normally.
This means when acquiring the item while channeling, enemies which have been in the area for more than 2.5 seconds instantly have Frostbite applied to them.
The tracker does not affect invulnerable or hidden units.
SCEPTER Freezing Field no longer requires channeling and Crystal Maiden can move and act freely during its duration.
Still interrupts Crystal Maiden's channeling abilities upon cast.
While Freezing Field is active, it applies a 75% movement speed slow on Crystal Maiden, which can be off-set by movement speed bonuses, including haste.
Freezing Field is interrupted if Crystal Maiden gets stunned, silenced, cycloned, feared, hexed or slept during it.
It also stops when Crystal Maiden dies, or when she uses the  Stop Freezing Field sub-ability.
The following abilities are no longer able to interrupt Freezing Field:
 Glimpse,  Earth Splitter,  Relocate,  Recall,  X Marks the Spot,  Return,  Overgrowth and  Nether Swap.
SPELL STEAL The passive  Frostbite applied is based on  Crystal Maiden's current ability level when acquired.
SOULBIND The passive  Frostbite applied on any of the targets is not shared with the other. Stop Freezing Field RF
